<h1 title="">THE RADIO BOYS WITH THE BORDER PATROL</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE ARMY FLYER.</span></h2>
<p>The tall, sun-browned man whose active sinewy
figure belied his fifty years closed the switch,
whipped off the headphones and smiling fondly
turned to his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out to the field, Captain Cornell,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see as pretty a landing as any flyer
in the Southwest can make. That was my boy Jack.
Radioed he&rsquo;d be here in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uniformed army flyer from the Laredo flight
of the Border Patrol smiled and nodded. Younger
than Mr. Hampton by many years, in fact but half
his age, he yet found his host a congenial spirit.
Since his forced landing that morning on the
terrace which the Hamptons had cleared on their
Southwestern ranch, the two men had found much
in common to discuss. Already they were fast on
the way towards becoming real friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Together they stepped from the radio shack into
the hot sunshine. After the comparative coolness
of the interior with its whirring electric fan, the
outdoors was like a furnace. League on league
the mesquite covered plains stretched away to the
distant needle-like peaks of the westward range, unbroken
by building of any sort; by tree or moving
object.</p>
<p>Behind them, however, lay the group of ranch
buildings. There was the long low main structure,
built of timbers and &rsquo;dobe, thick-walled, with cool
interior and a shaded patio built about a spring. To
one side rose a spindling tower at the foot of which
crouched the radio shack. On the right was the
corrugated-iron hanger, radiating heat like an oven
in shimmering heat waves; and towards this the two
men made their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do yourself well here,&rdquo; said Captain
Cornell, looking from the beautifully levelled
landing field, with its hanger and piped gas flares for
night lighting, to the radio tower and the comfortable
ranch house. The stables and corrals were out
of sight in a draw, hidden by the dwelling.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have all the money I
need and more. Besides, as I told you, Jack is out
here experimenting for the radio people, and they
paid for doing over my little station and equipping
it anew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now they had reached the landing field, and
Mr. Hampton raising his voice shouted: &ldquo;Ho Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A figure, followed by another, rounded the corner
of the hanger. Tom Bodine and his new assistant
had been lounging on the shaded side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great old-timer,&rdquo; commented Mr. Hampton in
a low voice as Tom Bodine approached in response
to his beckoning wave of a hand. &ldquo;Tell you some
time about how he saved the lives of Jack and his
pals, Bob Temple and Frank Merrick. It was down
in old Mexico, when the boys were all several years
younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flyer noted with approval the sinewy muscular
figure of the ex-cowpuncher who approached
without self-consciousness, alone, his assistant having
dropped back. Grizzled, sun-browned, walking
with the rolling gait of the man who had spent a
lifetime in the saddle, Tom Bodine looked what he
was&mdash;an outdoor man of the wide open ranges.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton introduced them, and the two men
shook hands. Each noted with a pleasurable thrill
the firm grip of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack radioed he&rsquo;d be landing soon,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Through puckered eyelids his sharp blue eyes
swept the sky to the south. A haze which had filled
the sky for days, telling of sand whipped off of the
Mexican desert hundreds of miles away by a wind
storm, obscured the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he comes,&rdquo; he said suddenly, pointing.</p>
<p>The gaze of the others followed. Heads nodded.
They, too, saw the distant speck which betokened
the approaching plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I left him plenty of room for landing,&rdquo;
said the army man, casting a glance towards his own
De Haviland near the hanger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, suh,&rdquo; said Tom, not withdrawing his gaze
from the sky. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t here when you come down,
but afterwards I wheeled yo&rsquo;r bus to the south end.
See? She won&rsquo;t be in Jack&rsquo;s way. Besides, that
boy could land on a nickel a&rsquo;most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such obvious pride in his voice that
again Captain Cornell smiled discreetly. To himself
he said that he wished people felt that way about
him. But he did not do himself justice. He was
one of the best-liked men of the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>On came Jack, the thrumming of his motor clearly
heard by the watchers below. When almost overhead,
the tune of the motor changed, and Captain
Cornell&rsquo;s practised ear could tell that Jack had
throttled down to eight or nine hundred revolutions.
He was nosing down. His plane was shooting
earthward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>When little more than a thousand feet up, the
plane was thrown into a tight spiral. Then Jack
began circling downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty work,&rdquo; muttered the army flyer. And
Mr. Hampton overhearing could have gripped the
other&rsquo;s hand in his pleasure. The way to his heart
lay through praise of his motherless son.</p>
<p>At two hundred feet the plane was seen to
straighten out, and then Jack leaned overside and
waved a greeting. He dropped down within fifty
feet and then, with wide-open motor, roared along
above the field towards the north end. There he
turned for the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always a ticklish task for a young flyer,&rdquo; commented
Captain Cornell, as the three men stood
grouped and motionless, watching, while waiting beside
the hanger could be seen the figure of the
mechanic. &ldquo;But he certainly handles himself like a
veteran. Look at that,&rdquo; he commented, as Jack shot
downward in a shallow glide. &ldquo;Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack levelled off a foot or so above the ground.
Then tail-skid and wheels dropped to the hard-packed
sand for a three-point landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; the army flyer commented again, as
he and Mr. Hampton started forward, with Tom
Bodine rolling-leggedly alongside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Tom and the mechanic who approached from the
other side took the wings and guided the idling ship
towards the hanger, but Jack waved them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to run the
motor out of gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obedient they stepped back. Then in a few moments,
Jack snapped her off, and stepped out of the
cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Got your message
about Captain Cornell having honored us, so here I
am. But if I hadn&rsquo;t been taking Isabella for a ride
when you radioed this morning, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
gotten me. Their radio&rsquo;s out of commission. Tell
you about it later. But here I am running on and
you haven&rsquo;t introduced us yet. Captain Cornell, I
guess,&rdquo; he added, turning squarely towards the
army man, and holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mighty glad to meet you,&rdquo; asserted the
other, as their hands met. &ldquo;Pretty landing,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>Jack flushed under the praise, but so tanned was
he like all the others that it would have been hard
to distinguish the mantling blood in his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was nothing,&rdquo; he demurred. &ldquo;But still
it&rsquo;s mighty nice of you to say so. Excuse me a
minute while I talk with Tom. Something I want
him to fix up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he strode off to where Tom Bodine
and his mechanic were now trundling the plane into
the hanger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Captain Cornell saw a square-shouldered lean
youth, hard as nails, almost six feet tall, with an
open and ingenuous countenance who bore himself
with an air of confident assurance. When Mr.
Hampton earlier had been elaborating on Jack&rsquo;s
merits and capabilities and had told him somewhat
of the confidence reposed in his son by the great
radio trust which had commissioned him to carry
out experiments in research and engineering problems,
the army flyer had been inclined to discount
the tale to a certain extent on the ground of parental
partiality. But now he experienced an instinctive
liking for Jack, and felt that in all likelihood Mr.
Hampton had not been exaggerating.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by Jack&rsquo;s quick return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; said Jack, tearing off his helmet and
letting his damp hair blow in the light wind. &ldquo;This
heat is terrible. Haven&rsquo;t had a day like this for
ages. Big storm working up from the south, I&rsquo;m
afraid. Certainly was cooler up above. Well come
on, let&rsquo;s get out of the sun. Besides, I want something
cool to drink. Then you can tell me how you
happened to land here, Captain Cornell. And, I&rsquo;ll
have something that will interest a man of the
Border Patrol, or else I&rsquo;m mighty badly mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, what do you mean?&rdquo; questioned his
father, striding beside him towards the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds mysterious,&rdquo; commented Captain Cornell,
on Jack&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, too&mdash;mysterious,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Something brewing down there in the mountains
behind Rafaela&rsquo;s home that I don&rsquo;t understand.
Neither does her father. But let&rsquo;s get inside where
it&rsquo;s cool, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know about it, which
isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;THAT DEVIL RAMIREZ.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>With laughing apology for an ever-present appetite,
Jack declared he must have food as well as
the cooling limeade set out for him on the table in the
shaded patio. So Ramon of the grizzled bushy hair
and the drooping mustache and brown-paper cigarette
was summoned from the kitchen, and with remarkable
celerity he had salads and cold meat for all
three on the table.</p>
<p>While he ate, Jack, out of politeness, questioned
Captain Cornell regarding the accident which had
forced him down, learning it was due to a leak in
his gas tank which Tom Bodine already had soldered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have been on my way, thanks to your
father filling my tank,&rdquo; explained the army flyer,
&ldquo;but I am merely on my way back to Laredo, with
no particular reason for getting there in a hurry,
and so I decided to stay and give myself the pleasure
of meeting you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>He paused, regarding Jack curiously. Certainly
this unassuming, quiet-mannered young fellow,
scarcely out of his &rsquo;teens, did not resemble the taker
of hair breadth chances whom he had pictured
mentally as a result of listening to Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
descriptions of some of the escapades enjoyed by Jack
and his two pals, Bob Temple and Frank Merrick, in
South America, Africa, the Far North and at home.
Neither did he look like a scientist, yet Mr. Hampton
had assured Captain Cornell that his son was
out here performing abstruse research experiments
in radio for the benefit of the great radio trust.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s blue eyes twinkled, and looking at his father
he shook his head as if in humorous disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been boring visitors again, Dad, with your
reminiscenses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your idea of
hospitality, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to Captain Cornell, he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how it is with fond parents, Captain.
Don&rsquo;t mind him. And don&rsquo;t hold what he says
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;But, if
I may be pardoned for seeming personal, how is
it you happen to be here without your pals? Your
father spoke of you three as being inseparable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; explained Jack, &ldquo;I was a year
ahead of the other fellows at Yale. I took my degree
in engineering at Sheffield in the Spring. The
others are plugging away on their Senior year.
They&rsquo;ll be through in a matter of six weeks or so, and
then they&rsquo;ll be out to spend the Summer with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to explain all your history,
Jack,&rdquo; interpolated Mr. Hampton with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Captain Cornell nodded. &ldquo;And what do
you all intend to do then? Get into more adventures?
Things are pretty quiet along the border
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked up from his salad, his face grown
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so quiet as you might think, Captain,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I intended to tell you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father and the army flyer sat forward alertly,
with a sudden scraping of chair legs on the flagstone
paving of the patio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Jack?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>Jack pushed back his plate and slumped down
comfortably in his chair, his crossed ankles resting
on the curbing of the fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I learned at Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s today,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Don Ferdinand was an irascible yet lovable old
Spanish aristocrat living in the Sonoran mountains
of old Mexico below the border. Several years before
Jack and his father had made the old Don&rsquo;s
acquaintance under strange circumstances. Don
Ferdinand was immensely wealthy and lived in
feudal state in a palace in the wilderness, surrounded
by many retainers. At that time he had been in
opposition to the Obregon government. Seeking
to embroil Mexico and the United States and thus
further his plans for unseating Obregon as President,
he had made a raid across the border and
carried Mr. Hampton away captive. He then had
sent word to Mr. Temple, his prisoner&rsquo;s partner and
the father of Jack&rsquo;s big pal, Bob Temple, to the effect
that Mr. Hampton would be held for ransom. Don
Ferdinand had figured that Mr. Temple would appeal
to the American government and that thus
trouble between the Obregon government and the
United States would be engendered. But Jack
Hampton and his pals undertook to rescue the older
man without public appeal, and penetrating the
Sonoran wilderness they managed to accomplish
their object. Since then Don Ferdinand and Mr.
Hampton had become fast friends. As for Jack and
the Senorita Rafaela, they had corresponded with
each other, and now that Jack was back in the
South-west, he had spent more and more time below
the border.</p>
<p>After his remark, Jack sat silent an appreciable
space of time. Finally, his father becoming impatient
broke out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Jack, go on. You say something
happened down at Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s today, and you
get us all excited. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you could really say something
happened,&rdquo; said Jack, choosing his words
carefully. &ldquo;But Don Ferdinand got pretty warm
under the collar. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll start at the beginning&mdash;it
wasn&rsquo;t much, and yet it might mean a lot&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll give it to you as I got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Ramon came slithering, across the flagstones
in the moccasins which he always wore because of
tender feet, and Jack cast a glance at him and then
ceased speaking until the Mexican had deposited the
coffee cups and departed with the luncheon plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ferdinand told me not to speak of this to
anybody whom we couldn&rsquo;t trust thoroughly,&rdquo; he
said, by way of explanation, and with a nod towards
the departing figure of Ramon he added: &ldquo;The old
man is a good <i>hombre</i> so far as we knew. But Don
Ferdinand was insistent that I shouldn&rsquo;t let out a
word before any Mexicans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mighty warm down there, with that hot
wind blowing, and I hadn&rsquo;t slept well. Too hot for
comfort. Pitched and tossed all night. Flew down
yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; he threw out for Captain Cornell&rsquo;s
understanding. &ldquo;So the old don, Rafaela
and I were sitting in the patio this morning, trying
to keep cool. He was asleep, I expect, because, he
hadn&rsquo;t said a word for a long time. So was the old
duenna in the background somewhere. Rafaela and
I were talking in low voices, so as not to disturb the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man came into the patio, a rough-looking,
villainous fellow. I did not remember ever seeing
him about the place, but then there is a veritable army
of retainers always hanging about, a sort of feudal
lot of dependents; so that wasn&rsquo;t strange. Anyway,
Rafaela knew him, for, when he made a low bow
and stood there with his high-crowned sombrero in
hand, she spoke to him sharply, asking what he
wanted. He replied that he wanted to speak to Don
Ferdinand, and Rafaela waked her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ferdinand took a good look at the man, then
he jumped up out of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You, Pedro, what are you doing here?&rsquo; he demanded.
&lsquo;So far from the mine? Has anything
gone wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedro came closer, said something in a low voice.
Then Don Ferdinand cast a quick glance toward
Rafaela and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, Senor Jack,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a thousand pardons.
Permit me&mdash; There is a little matter of business
to attend to.&rsquo; And with a bow to me he made off
toward his office, Pedro at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, leaning back, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
much about the incident. These fellows are always
so mysterious anyhow, about the merest trifles. I
didn&rsquo;t even ask Rafaela who the fellow was. She
herself volunteered the information, saying he was
foreman of a silver mine far back in the mountains
which Don Ferdinand owns. For a long time, the
old don had refrained from working the mine. He
had sealed it up during the troubled years following
the Madero revolution, although when Diaz had been
President it had been a big producer. Now he had
resumed operations again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some little trouble at the mine brings Pedro,&rsquo;
said Rafaela. &lsquo;Oh, you men with your business.
But look, Jack,&rsquo; she added, in a low voice, &lsquo;Donna
Ana sleeps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked around. The old duenna was snoozing
so hard, it would have taken an earthquake to wake
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The heat&rsquo;s got her,&rsquo; I said, for it certainly was
hot, even there in the shaded patio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Rafaela thought me pretty dense, by the
way she looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that all you can think about?&rsquo; she asked.
&lsquo;But, you think about the heat&mdash;well, wouldn&rsquo;t it be
fine to go flying? So nice and cool?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I tumbled. &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tiptoed out of the patio like a couple of conspirators.
The old duenna never stirred. Don
Ferdinand wasn&rsquo;t in sight. Neither was anybody else
at the front of the house. And out behind, in the
quarters, I expect everybody was taking a siesta.
Anyway, we couldn&rsquo;t hear a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;So off we trotted across the lawn and disappeared
among the eucalyptus trees&mdash;you know, Dad, cutting
off the house from the don&rsquo;s landing field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded, a reminiscent light in his
eyes. He was remembering the scene which had become
so familiar during his period of captivity several
years before.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell opened his eyes. &ldquo;A landing
field?&rdquo; he demanded, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; explained Jack. &ldquo;Several years back,
when the old don was an unreconstructed Mexican
rebel, he had a couple of airplanes in his pay. Several
of his aviators even stole ours&mdash;that is Bob&rsquo;s
and Frank&rsquo;s&mdash;airplane. But we got it back. The
airplanes are gone, as well as most of the rebel army
Don Ferdinand was feeding at that time. But the
flying field remains. It&rsquo;s in pretty good shape too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Rafaela and I popped
out on the field, and I put her in the plane. Then I
stirred up a couple of sleepy Mexicans whom I&rsquo;ve
trained to help me. We got her going, and after
I&rsquo;d warmed her up, we took off for a spin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, say, Dad,&rdquo; he added, in a burst of enthusiasm,
&ldquo;that girl&rsquo;s one good sport. She certainly
loves to fly. One of these days I&rsquo;m just going to
have to teach her. Trouble is, they never let her go
up. This was only her second or third flight. And,
my, how tickled she was over stealing away from
her duenna.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton tried to look reproving but failed
lamentably. Nevertheless, he warned: &ldquo;Just the
same, you mustn&rsquo;t do that again, Jack, without her
father&rsquo;s consent. What if something happened, some
accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fly high with
her, and I didn&rsquo;t take off until the old bus was tuned
up and running like a watch. Anyhow,&rdquo; he added,
hastening to change the subject, &ldquo;it was a good thing
I went up because it was then I got your radio
message, saying Captain Cornell was here and asking
me to come home. The don&rsquo;s station was out of
order again. Some Mexican kid is always monkeying
with something or other and putting the whole
works out of commission. When it&rsquo;s working,
Rafaela says, they get all the big stations. And&rdquo;&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;&ldquo;she says it&rsquo;s a regular thing for all the
Mexicans to turn out since I installed that loud
speaker for them, and dance on the flying field at
night to the band music they pull out of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, back we flew, and I landed her
safely and left the motor idling while we walked up
to the house. I intended to see her home, say good-bye
to the don, and come back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old duenna was still asleep. But just as we
stepped back in the patio Don Ferdinand appeared
in a state of pretty high excitement. I thought for
a minute he was going to comb me for taking
Rafaela up in the plane without permission. But,
no; he wasn&rsquo;t even aware that we had been flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, father?&rsquo; asked Rafaela,
anxiously. &lsquo;Has anything happened? Did Pedro
bring bad news?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old don walked up and down a few steps,
clasping and unclasping his hands behind his back.
&lsquo;Just when the mine was beginning to pay again,&rsquo;
he mourned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me what is the matter, father,&rsquo; demanded
Rafaela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He halted and faced us. &lsquo;Matter? Matter?&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;Matter enough. That devil Ramirez has lured
all my men away. They laugh when Pedro begs
them to stay and say they will follow Ramirez who
will make them rich. Pedro cannot get anybody to
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you can send other men,&rsquo; said Rafaela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bah,&rsquo; said Don Ferdinand. &lsquo;You are just a girl.
What do you know about such matters? If Ramirez
takes some men, will he not take others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rafaela shrugged and spread out her hands.
&lsquo;But you are rich, father. You need not worry about
the mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Foolish child,&rsquo; said Don Ferdinand, and he appealed
to me. &lsquo;Women do not know,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Why
does Ramirez lure my men away, if not to make
revolution? And revolution will upset everything
again. Bah, we have had enough of revolutions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton interrupted with an abrupt but
hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just like him? He wants no revolutions
unless he makes them himself. When I think of
several years ago&mdash;&rdquo; And he laughed again.</p>
<p>Jack smiled, too. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, Dad,&rdquo;
he said. And then, becoming serious, he added:
&ldquo;Anyhow, there is another revolution brewing, Captain
Cornell, it is liable to make trouble for you fellows
of the Border Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The army flyer nodded. His face wore a puzzled
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramirez?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ramirez? Never heard
of him. And I know most of the trouble-makers by
name, besides. Your friend Don Ferdinand referred
to him as &lsquo;that devil Ramirez,&rsquo; hey? Did he explain
further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He just cautioned me not to
speak of this to any of our Mexicans, and said he
would have more news for me later. Then I came
away. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know but what he contemplates lighting out
after Ramirez himself. He&rsquo;s quite an intrepid old
fellow, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The conversation thereupon became more general,
Captain Cornell questioning Jack regarding his radio
experiments. They walked out to the radio shack.
And there Jack launched into an enthusiastic description
of his work. He was seeking, he said, to work
out some of the fundamental problems demanding
solution as a result of the tremendous increase in both
broadcasting stations and receivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are six or seven such problems,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;First, we must have a radio receiver which will provide
super-selectivity&mdash;a receiver which will enable
the Operator to select any station he wants to hear,
whether or not local stations are operating. Such
selectivity must go to the theoretical limits of the
science. Here&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to a litter on a work
bench which was only a meaningless jumble to the
flyer&mdash;&ldquo;is a pretty close approach, or it soon will be,&rdquo;
he corrected himself, &ldquo;to what I want. It will be a
super-sensitive receiver, giving volume from distant
stations as well as selectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here and there he went about the shack, taking
up or lying down pieces of apparatus, and keeping
up a running fire of comment which made the flyer&rsquo;s
head swim.</p>
<p>He was working, he said, on the problem of
achieving a &ldquo;non-radiating&rdquo; receiver&mdash;one, which,
no matter how handled, wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with a
neighbor&rsquo;s enjoyment. He was trying to improve
the complicated Super-Heterodyne in sensitiveness
and selectivity, so that anybody could have access to
its wonders, regardless of whether he possessed any
engineering skill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>And at that point, Captain Cornell groaning
humorously clapped his hand to his head and staggered
toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott, Mr. Hampton,&rdquo; he appealed, &ldquo;call
him off, will you? I didn&rsquo;t know there <i>was</i> so much
to radio. I&rsquo;m willing to believe your son&rsquo;s the greatest
radio engineer in the world, but tell him to have
a heart. Understanding about airplanes is as far as
my feeble intelligence will carry me. I can&rsquo;t cram
radio into it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hamptons both laughed, and followed him
outside. There, with a look at the sky, Captain
Cornell gave a sudden startled exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be getting along,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just
enough daylight going to be left for me to get to
Laredo. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like that look in the South.
One of these desert siroccos playing away off there
somewhere. And who knows when it may take a
notion to come wandering up here? Will you folks
help me get away?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">DON FERDINAND DISAPPEARS.</span></h2>
<p>Tom Bodine had seen them start across the field,
and by the time they reached the side of the big De
Haviland used by the Border Patrol flyer, the motors
were gently idling. Tom, clambering out of the cockpit
announced proudly that everything was ship-shape.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell&rsquo;s face beamed as he took his place
in the front cockpit. This was real service. He
liked Tom, good man. He liked these Hamptons,
too. His practiced eye ran over the dials in front
of him, noting that air pressure, temperature, and
oil pressure were correct. The big bomber breathing
fire from its exhaust pipes as it strained against the
wheel blocks was like a great bird eager to take
the air.</p>
<p>A sudden thought came to Captain Cornell, and
leaning out he shouted through cupped hands in
order to make himself heard above the roar of the
warming motor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look up Ramirez&rsquo;s record in Laredo and give
you a call on the radio if I learn anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Jack shook his head. He couldn&rsquo;t hear. Captain
Cornell throttled down and repeated his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;And if I can be of
any help, call on me. And, say, Captain,&rdquo; he added
as an afterthought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dropping in on you at
Laredo one of these days. Dad and I want to see
a bull fight. Maybe you&rsquo;ll take us over into the
Mexican town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know,&rdquo; the flyer called. &ldquo;Come
on a Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with the battery charging and the motor
firing sweetly, he threw off one switch of the double-ignition
system in order to listen for breaks in the
twelve-cylinder Liberty. The same operation on the
other. Both running true. A wave of the hand, in
farewell, and he eased the throttle on. Slowly the
tachometer climbed up the scale, showing increasing
revolutions.</p>
<p>The flyer nodded to Tom and Jack at the wings.
They disappeared and then popped out, dragging the
wheel blocks. Tom&rsquo;s assistant stepped away from
the tail. Then the big ship started forward easily,
smoothly, and within thirty yards the tail-skid left
the ground. Motor roaring without a break, the De
Haviland ran a bit farther, then took the air. Driving
along a little above the ground, it shot upward.
Then a right bank and the flyer circled the field,
making sure his great plane was running true before
letting her out for Laredo. Twice around the field,
and then away shot the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some bus,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>None of the little group had said a word up to
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot more trouble to work her than your little
racer, Jack,&rdquo; said Tom Bodine with the freedom born
of years of friendship.</p>
<p>Jack nodded. &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;m going to ask Captain
Cornell to let me handle her. If I ever see
him again,&rdquo; he added, as he and Mr. Hampton returned
toward the house.</p>
<p>But Jack was to see Captain Cornell again, and
that right soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he spent the next several days
engaged on his radio experimentation. Mr. Hampton
saw little of him, except at meals. But the older
man was himself engaged, being deep in the writing
of a technical engineering paper. So the time did
not hang heavy on his hands.</p>
<p>Jack reported one night enthusiastically that his
research had definitely established that the complicated
Super-Heterodyne could be simplified to the
point where anybody, &ldquo;even a child,&rdquo; he said with
such a tone of scorn as to make his father smile,
could work it. Then he plunged again into his experiments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Four or five days after the unexpected visit of the
army flyer, Tom Bodine returning from a ride into
Red Butte, ten miles away, brought a bundle of mail.
Mail at the ranch was always an event, so Jack was
summoned from his radio shack to the house, and
he and his father abandoned their various pursuits
for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Dad, here&rsquo;s a letter from Frank,&rdquo; cried
Jack, pouncing on a bulky missive, and slitting it
open. &ldquo;Now to hear the news from home.&rdquo; And
with the stiff sheets crinkling, he threw himself down
in a deep leather chair while his eyes started to devour
the page.</p>
<p>The next moment he bounded to his feet with a
whoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray, Dad,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;Guess what! The
fellows have both passed their exams. Now they
have nothing to do for six weeks, when they&rsquo;ll have
to show up for Commencement. They&rsquo;re coming out
to spend the intervening time with us.&rdquo; His eyes
skimmed the pages. &ldquo;Been planning on this for a
long time but kept it a secret. Bob wasn&rsquo;t sure he
could pass, but he crammed. Got a creditable rating.
And Mr. Temple&rsquo;s coming, too. What do you
know about that, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>And tossing the letter upon the table, Jack grabbed
his father by the shoulders and began whirling him
around the room. Not until he had kicked over several
chairs and bumped into the table with a crash
that brought a howl of pain did he come to a halt.
Then Mr. Hampton looked at his flushed face and
shining eyes and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Temple told me the same thing here,&rdquo; he
said, extending the letter he himself had been reading.
He shook his head. &ldquo;Poor Temple and I.
We&rsquo;ll have our hands full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here&mdash; Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Jack retrieved the
letter from the table, turning to the date. &ldquo;Why,
they&rsquo;ll be at San Antone the twentieth. And this is
the seventeenth, isn&rsquo;t it? I lose track of time out
here. Stay in San Antone a day, and then come on
to Red Butte. Golly, Dad, they&rsquo;ll be here in five
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Jack announced he was going to
carry the news to their friends in Mexico. They
would be glad to hear it, he said, especially Don
Ferdinand who had taken a great liking to big Bob
Temple because of the way in which the young
athlete had performed prodigies of strength in the
rescue of Mr. Hampton, several years before. Don
Ferdinand had been the victim, but he was a game
loser. And because of the warm friendliness which
had developed between the two parties since that bygone
time, he could afford to smile at all that had
happened now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go along with me, Dad?&rdquo; Jack
suddenly suggested. &ldquo;Do you good to get away
from your poky old writing. Come on. Blow the
cobwebs out of your brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, after a moment
or two of thought. &ldquo;Wait till I tell Ramon
we won&rsquo;t be home for dinner. He&rsquo;d feel hurt if we
didn&rsquo;t let him know. Besides, I&rsquo;ll need my helmet
and goggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was absent, Jack and Tom Bodine tuned
up the motor of Jack&rsquo;s two-seater, of which Tom
stood in considerable awe, yet which he teasingly referred
to as &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s air flivver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton returned wearing a puzzled expression.
He explained that he had been unable to find
Ramon. This was strange, as the old fellow seldom
stirred from his kitchen. He inquired of Tom
whether the latter had seen him since breakfast.
Tom shook his head in denial, but his tow-headed
assistant, a youngster from Red Butte, who approached
in time to overhear the question, spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, Mr. Hampton, I seen him light out
toward Red Butte &rsquo;bout an hour or two ago. He
come out o&rsquo; the back o&rsquo; the house soon after breakfast.
I was out here where I sleep&rdquo;&mdash;nodding
toward the hanger. &ldquo;He was hobblin&rsquo; right fast on
them bad feet o&rsquo; hisn. Stops by the road an&rsquo; along
comes that Mexican feller in town what runs the
flivver at the station, just like he had a date t&rsquo; meet
Ramon. So the old feller gets in an&rsquo; away they go
toward Red Butte.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s face cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose he wanted to go to Red Butte to
order supplies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s queer he didn&rsquo;t
say something about it at breakfast. Well, come on,
Jack. Let&rsquo;s get going. You fellows will have to
feed yourselves, Tom. I think there&rsquo;s plenty of food
in the storehouse, and I know how well you can cook
flapjacks. So I guess you won&rsquo;t starve before Ramon
gets back. We&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow. Don Ferdinand
wouldn&rsquo;t let us come back tonight, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, at a nod from Jack, Tom and his
assistant who was known as &ldquo;Whitey,&rdquo; withdrew the
wheel blocks. The motor was already well tuned,
everything was working satisfactorily. Jack glanced
up at the wind-indicator, noting that the take-off
would be south, just as he was headed. Then he
advanced the throttle smoothly, being careful not to
over-feed the motor, and the graceful light plane instantly
started forward in response.</p>
<p>A quick shoot forward, then up. When his altimeter
showed he was up twelve hundred feet, and
with everything running smoothly, Jack dropped the
flying field behind and headed away for the distant
mountains within which lay Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s feudal
estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Before starting he had suggested that his father
should endeavor to call Don Ferdinand on the radio
from the plane. The German who once, in the don&rsquo;s
belligerent days, had operated the radio outfit, long
since had taken his departure. But Jack had instructed
Manuel Sanchez, an intelligent young fellow
of Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s retainers, in the operation of
the radio station. He had even overhauled the two-way
station himself recently. If Manuel had succeeded
in restoring the outfit to working condition
since Jack&rsquo;s last visit, Mr. Hampton might be able
to get a response.</p>
<p>However, no response was received. And at the
end of an hour and a half of flying over bare untrodden
desert country giving way to foothills, Jack
finally crossed the top of a low range and their destination
appeared in the valley below.</p>
<p>Jack swooped downward and leveled off a foot
above the ground of the flying field. Nobody came
running, but that was nothing unusual. Since Don
Ferdinand had dispensed with his airplanes, the field
was deserted. Only when Jack departed after a
visit could the men whom he had trained to help in
the take-off be found at hand. His hand dragged
back on the stick, and he dropped to the hard-packed
sand for a perfect three-point landing, wheels and
tail-skid hitting together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Shutting off the motor, Jack and Mr. Hampton
climbed out and started for the house. There was
no danger in leaving the plane. None of Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
people would have dared approach Jack&rsquo;s
plane or touch it.</p>
<p>As they walked toward the eucalyptus grove
shielding the house from the flying field, a lithe,
slender figure, skirts fluttering, emerged from the
trees, and began to run toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rafaela,&rdquo; cried Jack, and darting away from his
father&rsquo;s side he ran to meet her.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton smiled and continued at his own
more sober pace. He saw them meet, and saw Jack
suddenly take Rafaela in his arms.</p>
<p>That was a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know affairs
were that far along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when he approached closer he saw that
Rafaela was crying and that Jack was trying to
comfort her.</p>
<p>Jack looked up at him, an expression of dismay
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make much out of this, Dad,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;except that Don Ferdinand has disappeared, and
Rafaela is dreadfully worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">WORD FROM DON FERDINAND.</span></h2>
<p>Rafaela pulled away from Jack&rsquo;s arms quickly
at Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s approach. The latter cast her a
sharp glance and noted some slight confusion which
his quick perception told him was not due solely to
her anxiety over her father&rsquo;s disappearance. He
glanced at Jack, a question in his eyes. Jack grinned
shamelessly, and Mr. Hampton had difficulty preserving
a sober countenance. Evidently, his handsome
son did not object to offering Rafaela comfort
in her distress.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts leaped to the words still ringing
in his ears, informing him that Don Ferdinand
had disappeared. He turned to Rafaela to question
her. But at that moment, she emitted a sharp exclamation
as she held up a sealed envelope and
examined the superscription.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is from my father,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your father?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack. &ldquo;Thought
you said he had disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did say he had disappeared,&rdquo; answered Rafaela,
ripping open the envelope. And pulling out the
folded sheet which it contained she read it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this explains it,&rdquo; she added, dropping to her
side the hand holding the note, and facing the two
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come, let us go to the house. It is too hot
to stand here in the sun. Besides, you must be
thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And snuggling her hands under Jack&rsquo;s and his
father&rsquo;s nearest elbows, she started them marching
toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me puzzled, Rafaela,&rdquo; declared Jack.
&ldquo;First you declare your father has disappeared and
you say in that funny way of yours that you are
desolated. Then you get a note from him. What&rsquo;s
the answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rafaela&rsquo;s teasing laugh pealed out. &ldquo;What you
say, Jack? &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rsquo; Is that some of
your American slang? What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton laughed. Rafaela was a continual
delight to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Jack, solemnly, &ldquo;that if you don&rsquo;t
clear up this mystery, I&rsquo;ll appeal to Donna Ana.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Rafaela made a grimace. &ldquo;Oh, that duenna. She
sleeps. Not even your airplane wakes her. But
when I hear it, I run. &lsquo;Senor Jack will go search
for my father who is missing four days,&rsquo; I say to
myself. As I run, up comes that Pedro with a note.
He would stop me. But I am so anxious to ask you
to, please, go at once and search for my father, that
I take his note and run. He looked after me and
scratch his head. I see him, yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up slyly, first at Jack, then at his
father, and both laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little minx, Rafaela,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
pinching the shell-like ear nearest him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it unanimous, Dad,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But
go on, Rafaela. Now what does the note say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It say we must ask Pedro,&rdquo; declared Rafaela, as
they stepped into the cool patio. She clapped her
hands and a swarthy, stolid-faced woman appeared
at whom she shot a volley of Spanish, whereupon the
woman turned and went back under the colonnade
in the direction of the servant&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will call Pedro, and likewise bring us limeade,&rdquo;
said Rafaela. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound between exclamation and snort came
from behind Jack and he whirled around, in the act
of slipping into a big comfortable wicker chair.
Donna Ana, all in black, was staring at him severely
from the depths of another wicker chair in the shade
of a pineapple palm. He made her a low bow, while
Mr. Hampton walked up and bent over her hand
with that touch of Continental gallantry which always
flattered the duenna. Then he pulled his chair
close to her and began a conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of Dad,&rdquo; said Jack, in an undertone.</p>
<p>Rafaela glanced at him archly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are learning, Jack,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was a
pretty speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Pedro appeared, bowing, in front
of Rafaela. Mr. Hampton and Donna Ana moved
closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Rafaela, tapping the note,
&ldquo;writes only that he is well, and that I should ask
you for details.&rdquo; She addressed him in Spanish, but
as both Jack and his father understood the language,
they experienced no difficulty in following the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four day ago I send a message to Don Ferdinand,&rdquo;
said Pedro. &ldquo;It informed him that devil
Ramirez had lured away my last man from the mine
and asked for instructions. Soon&mdash;the next day&mdash;Don
Ferdinand appears. I am astonished. &lsquo;Your
messenger came at night, Pedro,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I left at
once.&rsquo; So I say to him, &lsquo;Let us make talk.&rsquo; But he
answers that he is fatigued and will sleep first. All
day he sleeps. That night we talk. The next day
he remembers suddenly that he has left you alone,
with no knowledge of what had become of him. He
does not want you to be alarmed. So he sends you
a message. There is none to take it but Pedro.
Here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>With a bow as graceful as a cavalier&rsquo;s Pedro
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my father.&rdquo; Rafaela&rsquo;s little foot in its tiny
black slipper was tapping on the flagstones. &ldquo;But
my father, why did he not return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scarcely perceptible pause before
Pedro replied. Then he said: &ldquo;He has work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedro, there is something you are keeping back
from me,&rdquo; declared Rafaela firmly. &ldquo;Tell me.
Where is my father now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrugging, Pedro spread out his hands, but he
did not answer.</p>
<p>Jack thought he understood. Stepping forward
impetuously, he laid a hand on Pedro&rsquo;s shoulder, and
faced him. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No tricks. If
anything has happened to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro glared blackly, but Rafaela laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, you are so&mdash;so funny,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t suspect Pedro. He is my father&rsquo;s
most trusted man.&rdquo; And to Pedro, she said soothingly:
&ldquo;This gentleman didn&rsquo;t understand, Pedro.
He but worries about my father. If he knew, he
would not hurt your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro made a slight bow to Jack. &ldquo;I forgive the
young Senor&rsquo;s mistake,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jack sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;But, Rafaela,
what then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know my father,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I
fear he has done something rash and ordered Pedro
not to tell me for fear I would be worried. Is it not
so, Pedro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter shrugged. It was an eloquent shrug.
It said plainer than words that Rafaela was correct.</p>
<p>The girl was silent a moment, sitting with chin
cupped in hand, staring thoughtfully at the paving
at her feet. Then she glanced up quickly, understanding
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Ramirez of whom you speak? Where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He marches toward Nueva Laredo,&rdquo; said Pedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my father has gone in pursuit of him alone,&rdquo;
said Rafaela. It was more a challenge than a question.</p>
<p>Pedro hesitated. Rafaela stamped her foot.
Pedro made haste to confirm her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only, Senorita, he goes not alone. A dozen men
he brought with him to the mine&mdash;these lazy fellows
who grow fat here on his bounty. Yet they are good
fighters and will lay down their lives for him. And
all are well armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Rafaela, with conviction. &ldquo;And
he told you not to tell me. Well, that is all, Pedro.
Rest now before you go back to the mine. For I
suppose you will want to return?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Si, Senorita. I was not to tell, but you found
out. I never could keep secrets from a woman.&rdquo;
Pedro&rsquo;s resignation was so comical that involuntarily
all laughed. &ldquo;And when I return,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall
want twelve more good fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have them,&rdquo; promised Rafaela. And
with a bow Pedro disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, when he had departed,
&ldquo;this is a pretty kettle of fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kettle of fish?&rsquo;&rdquo; Rafaela looked inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more slang,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;Dad is worse
than I. He means here is a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid now appeared with a great silver pitcher
and a tray of glasses, a little table was pulled forward,
and about it all four sat, sipping limeade, and
discussing the news brought by Pedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be worth while to question
that fellow, Pedro, again,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
finally, after the situation had been thrashed over.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s told us all he&rsquo;s going to tell. And I don&rsquo;t see,
Rafaela, that there is anything we can do. Your
father knows his own business, and I consider he is
pretty well able to take care of himself. As far as
I can see, this fellow Ramirez, whoever he is, is preparing
to stir up trouble, and your father is trying
to stop him. Jack and I are Americans, and we can&rsquo;t
very well take a hand in a Mexican family row.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Jack looked disappointed. Nothing would have
suited him better than to step into his plane and fly
southward in search of Don Ferdinand for the purpose
of placing himself and his airplane at the latter&rsquo;s
disposal. Still, his father was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Rafaela,&rdquo; he supplemented, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to see that your radio station is in good running
order before I leave, and you must tell your boy to
keep in touch with me. Then, if you want us in a
hurry, we&rsquo;ll be at your command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening Pedro set out at dusk with twelve
mounted and heavily armed men at his back. They
were the pick of the young fellows about the place.
Standing a little apart from Mr. Hampton and
Donna Ana, Jack and Rafaela watched the departure.
Pedro rode up for final instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my father to be careful,&rdquo; said Rafaela. She
was worried, but held her head high, exhibiting the
same firey spirit of her father. The ghost of a smile
came to her lips. &ldquo;Not that he will heed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Pedro,&rdquo; added Jack, &ldquo;tell Don Ferdinand
when you see him that if I can help with my airplane&mdash;for
scouting&mdash;or&mdash;or something, why, to send a
messenger here and have me called by radio.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Pedro nodded, then with his rapscallion yet loyal
crew whirled away. Soon the dustcloud raised by
their departure settled, and they were lost in the
shadows of the night. The remaining Mexicans, who
had gathered to watch, dispersed. The tinkle of
stringed instruments came from the Mexican quarters.
The Hamptons, Rafaela and Donna Ana
turned back to the patio. There they sat conversing
until time to retire, and the next morning Mr. Hampton
and Jack took their departure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">OFF TO LAREDO.</span></h2>
<p>During ensuing days Jack paid strict attention to
his experimental work. He maintained daily radio
communication with Rafaela, learning that there had
been no further news from her father. But he made
no more trips below the line. Tom Bodine tried to
lure him away into the mountains on a fishing expedition,
but he turned a deaf ear, leaving the older
man disconsolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allus a-potterin&rsquo; &rsquo;round with that radio stuff,&rdquo;
said Tom contemptuously, lounging in the doorway
of the radio shack. He made a clear-cut figure, like
a Remington painting of the Old West, against the
background of blazing sunshine and desert seen
through the open doorway. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know why yo&rsquo;re
so crazy &rsquo;bout it, Jack,&rdquo; he said turning away.
&ldquo;Bringin&rsquo; the noises o&rsquo; the world into the desert,
that&rsquo;s what yo&rsquo;re a-doin.&rsquo; Some day ye&rsquo;ll regret it,
when ye ain&rsquo;t got no place to go where ye kin have
peace an&rsquo; quiet.&rdquo; And he stumped away, with Jack&rsquo;s
laugh ringing in his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>But Jack&rsquo;s experiments in simplification of the
Super-Heterodyne were progressing satisfactorily,
and he was pushing the work eagerly in order to
have something with which to surprise Frank and
Bob on their arrival. He had developed a special
transformer which he felt assured was superior to
anything then on the market. By its use he was receiving
stations from coast to coast, with crystal
clarity, loud speaker volume and minimum interference.
Every day he logged each station and later
singled it out again with the same dial setting. And
every day&rsquo;s patient experimentation found interference
decreasing and volume and clarity growing
stronger.</p>
<p>Then came the Saturday to which he had been
looking forward as the last day on which to get
everything in shape for the arrival of his two pals,
who were expected on the morrow. But as he
worked away that morning in the radio shack, he
suddenly heard his call. It was the usual hour at
which he was accustomed to call Rafaela, and as his
eyes travelled to the clock he experienced a sense of
guilt. So immersed in his work had he been that he
had ignored calling. Doubtless, this was Rafaela
summoning him.</p>
<p>But when he answered, a man&rsquo;s voice replied:
&ldquo;That you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Jack stuttered. He could hardly believe his ears.
Why, it couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;Yes sir, it was, it was! And
so eagerly that he could hardly make himself heard,
he shouted: &ldquo;Hel-lo, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, get away. Give me a chance,&rdquo; Jack heard
coming through the air. That was Frank. There
was the sound of a scuffle. Then loud and clear and
triumphant came Frank&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;The big bully.
Tried to keep me away. Wanted the first word.
But I&mdash;Ouch, leggo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the sound of scuffling, and then first Frank
and then Bob shouted into Jack&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Wherever they were, the two were certainly
larking. Finally, matters became pacified and then
Jack got in a question as to where they were calling
from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Laredo,&rdquo; Frank informed him, &ldquo;from the
flying field. Decided to come around this way to
reach you in order to stop off and see a bull fight.
Say, Jack, they tell us tomorrow will be the finest
bull fight in months across the line in the Mexican
town. We wanted to get you to come down. I
thought of this stunt of asking the army flyers to
let us call you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tall one, Jack,&rdquo; cut in Bob. &ldquo;It was my
bright idea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Another scuffling bout. &ldquo;Great Scott,&rdquo; said Jack
to himself, his face in one broad grin of delight,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been penned up in a train for days
and they&rsquo;ve just got to let off their animal spirits.
Only hope they don&rsquo;t tear things to pieces for the
army men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, fellows,&rdquo; he said, when again
matters had been pacified. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Dad and we&rsquo;ll
fly down late this afternoon. Look for us about
sunset. Then we can all go to the bull fight tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; endorsed Bob. &ldquo;We want
you, old scout. Kind of miss you, you know, and
that sort of thing.&rdquo; Bob was growing facetious to
hide his deeper feelings. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;my father is here, too, and he sort of wants to
foregather with your Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t blame him, can you, Jack?&rdquo; cut in Frank.
&ldquo;Think of his having to put up with Bob so many
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you fellows, cut that out, and listen to
me,&rdquo; expostulated Jack, as sounds reaching him
indicated the friendly wrestling bout was being renewed.
And when he once more had Bob&rsquo;s ear,
he told him to look up Captain Cornell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, Jack, you&rsquo;re late,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;It was
Captain Cornell who gave us the run of the place
soon as we told him we were your friends and that
it was you we wanted to radio.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack,&rdquo; added Frank, &ldquo;he told us to be sure
and get you to come to Laredo for tomorrow&rsquo;s bull
fight. Said he promised to take you to see a good
one, and that this promised to be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the conversation was ended, Jack
declared a truce to work for the time being and
set out at a run for the house. Hardly had he
gotten beyond the door of the shack, however, than
conscience smote him for not having communicated
with Rafaela. Turning back, he endeavored to
call her but was unable to get any response. &ldquo;Some
Mexican kid pulled out a couple of wires again, I
guess,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, everything must be
all right or she&rsquo;d have called me. No use worrying.
Besides, Dad will want the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, abandoning his efforts to raise Rafaela&rsquo;s
station, he set out on the run for the house.</p>
<p>Bursting into the comfortable living room, he
found his father seated in a broad deep chair in
front of the low table on which he was accustomed
to do his writing, and gazing up at Tom Bodine
who sat on a corner of the table at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just talking about what we&rsquo;ll have for dinner,
Jack,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, smiling at him. &ldquo;Name
your preference. Tom says he may not be able to
give us Mexican dishes like Ramon, but that since
Ramon deserted and left him the post of cook he&rsquo;ll
feed us American style. Now last night we had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grinned Jack, &ldquo;I know what we had;
beef and eggs, and night before eggs and beef.
But old Tom needn&rsquo;t worry his head about how to
vary the menu tonight, because you and I won&rsquo;t be
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be here?&rdquo; Mr. Hampton stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be eating at the Hamilton
Hotel in Laredo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished glances of the two men were his
only answer, and after enjoying their mystification a
moment Jack proceeded to enlighten them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to fly to Laredo to meet Frank and
Bob and Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just
radioed from the army flying field. Went to
Laredo in order to stop over and see the bull fight
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; said Tom, sliding off the table, and
preparing to depart, &ldquo;I kin see there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be
hotter days even than we been havin&rsquo; around here.
Give &rsquo;em my best, Jack. An&rsquo;, say, better bring a
cook back with ye. I&rsquo;ll ride inta Red Butte an&rsquo; git
some fresh supplies.&rdquo; At the door he paused to fling
over a shoulder: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the bull git ye.&rdquo; Then
he disappeared.</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &ldquo;Come on, Dad,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;put
your writing away and come on out to the hanger.
We&rsquo;ll have to go over the old bus an&rsquo; get her in tip-top
shape for the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Pretending reluctance, yet reluctance belied by
the eager twinkle in his eyes, Mr. Hampton complied.
And together they headed for the hanger,
where each donned voluminous coveralls and went
about the work of greasing and oiling, and the
tightening of struts and stays.</p>
<p>As they worked away, each busied upon a different
part of the plane from the other, each intent
upon his own thoughts, there was little opportunity
for conversation. But as his fingers flew about the
tasks which he performed almost mechanically,
Jack&rsquo;s thoughts were flying, too.</p>
<p>He started in by thinking of Bob and Frank.
They had been separated more than six months,
the longest period of separation for years. Communication
between the two at Yale and Jack in
the Southwest had been steady and continuous.
Yet, after all, what good were letters? Six or
seven months made a good many changes in a fellow.
What were they thinking about, how were
they dressing now, had Bob fully recovered from
the broken collarbone incurred in the game against
Harvard last Fall, was Frank putting himself in
trim for the Summer tennis season in which he
stood an excellent chance to rank high among the
national leaders? All these and many more questions
of like nature ran through Jack&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>And then, unconsciously, his thoughts drifted
away from his companions to Rafaela. Why
hadn&rsquo;t he been able to obtain a response to his call
that morning? Had affairs down there taken a
new turn? If so, what? And then, suddenly, apparently
without his having previously considered
the matter, the mysterious disappearance of Ramon
popped into Jack&rsquo;s mind. He gave a final turn to
a loose nut and, wrench in hand, stood up and
called to his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo; Mr. Hampton was crouched
down, examining the lock nut on one of the wheels,
and did not look up.</p>
<p>Jack walked around to the front of the plane
and leaned against the fuselage, tossing up and
catching his wrench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Dad. Just thought of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just this,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Maybe he, too,
has gone away to join this mysterious individual
Ramirez. Rebels must eat, and a good cook like
Ramon ought to be in demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, Jack,&rdquo; said his father, after
a moment&rsquo;s consideration. &ldquo;But, somehow,&rdquo; he
added, glancing up, &ldquo;I have a suspicion&mdash;well, you
can hardly call it that, because I have nothing to
go on&mdash;say, a feeling that the mysterious Ramirez
isn&rsquo;t contemplating revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; Jack demanded
in astonishment. &ldquo;Especially after what Don
Ferdinand said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, going
back to his task. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know what he can be
about if it isn&rsquo;t the stirring up of another revolution.
But, there it is. What you might call a
hunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack regarded his father&rsquo;s bowed head with a
puzzled frown. Then he straightened up and
moved briskly away. &ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t getting the
bus ready for her trip.&rdquo; And he went to work
again.</p>
<p>Whitey appeared from somewhere presently, rubbing
the sleep out of his eyes and announcing he
had been up all the night attending a dance at the
Horsethief Canyon School. He was put to work,
but was more hindrance than help. At noon they
knocked off work to take a cup of coffee and a
hastily-thrown-together sandwich. Tom had taken
the flivver and gone to Red Butte for supplies.
Then they returned to work again.</p>
<p>After the plane had been lubricated and overhauled,
it was trundled out onto the field, where,
while it strained against the wheel blocks, Jack
warmed it up. Everything was running sweet and
true. It was now the middle of the afternoon.
Jack once more attempted to raise Rafaela&rsquo;s station,
but again without success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May as well go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton was already aboard. Jack climbed
into the cockpit, Whitey dragged the wheel blocks
out of the way. Jack saw to it that the motor
shutters were open, the spark properly advanced
and the altitude adjustment was correct. Already,
during the warming-up process, he had satisfied
himself that the motor was working at its best. So
now he threw up his hand as a farewell signal to
Whitey, and slowly eased the throttle on. Five
minute&rsquo;s later, after a perfect take-off he was well
up and heading east.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">HIT FROM THE REAR.</span></h2>
<p>It was not yet dark when Jack reached the
Laredo air-drome. He dropped downward, sure
of his welcome. Skimming the fence on the western
end of the sandy flying field, he leveled off a
foot above the ground. A second later, he dragged
back on the stick, and the plane came down for a
perfect three-point landing of wheels and tail-skid.</p>
<p>As Jack stood idling, running out the gas, a little
group which had been watching his descent broke
up into its component parts. The members came
running, and a sound of cheering reached his ears.</p>
<p>Big Bob Temple led, with the slighter Frank
close at his heels. More sedately, Captain Cornell
who had been with them approached in the rear, in
companionship with Mr. Temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>As Jack and his father reached the ground, the
two youths in the lead literally fell on them and a
great to-do of back-thumping and handclasping
went on. Mr. Hampton was first to disentangle
himself, and moved to greet his old neighbor and
lifelong friend, Mr. Temple, who stood aside
watching with amused gaze the boisterous greetings
of the youths. Greetings over, Mr. Hampton
turned to the army flyer who expressed warm pleasure
at seeing him.</p>
<p>All three youths by now had their arms over
each others&rsquo; shoulders and were doing a dance reminiscent
of an Indian war fling. Not until they
were breathless did they separate, whereupon Jack
moved to greet Mr. Temple and Captain Cornell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about your plane,&rdquo; said Captain
Cornell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to several members of the airdrome
crew who took the wings on either side and
guided the ship into line with a number of De
Havilands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll go over it for you,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell,
&ldquo;and see that it&rsquo;s in ship-shape for going up
whenever you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s mighty good of you.&rdquo;
So eager was he to get away with Bob and Frank
that he had given no thought as to what he should
do with his plane.</p>
<p>Thereupon, with a brief word of farewell, the
three sallied off arm in arm, Jack in the middle,
toward where a taxi waited to take them into
Laredo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you all at dinner,&rdquo; called Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>His father nodded understandingly. When he
saw the taxi whirl away in a cloud of dust, Mr.
Temple turned to his companions with shaking
head and twinkling eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really oughtn&rsquo;t to let them go out of sight,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t get into mischief, it&rsquo;ll
merely be due to the fact that they&rsquo;re too busy
talking. Well, come on, I&rsquo;ve another taxi here,
George, and we&rsquo;ll follow to the Hamilton Hotel
and have dinner. Captain Cornell has consented to
honor us with his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men thereupon climbed into another
taxi, and followed toward the town.</p>
<p>Mr. Temple&rsquo;s prophecy of resultant mischief was
not fulfilled, however, for, aside from the fact that
the room occupied by Bob and Frank looked as if
a small cyclone had struck it, no damage had resulted
from the reunion of the three inseparables.
They were sprawled about the room in various
stages of undress, sweltering in the oven-like heat,
despite the coming of darkness and the whirling
electric fan. And their tongues were going at
such a great rate, as Jack attempted to put his comrades
in touch with the mysterious happenings of
recent days while they were informing him of the
doings of themselves and other of his friends at
Yale, that Mr. Temple put his fingers in his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get it out of your systems, fellows,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And then spruce up. We dine in a half
hour. Meet us in the dining room, and be sure
to be on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys entered the dining room of the
hotel, they found the three men already there and
seated at a table for six. The room was crowded,
every chair taken. But the three empty chairs at
their table had been turned down, and the head
waiter had shooed away interlopers. All three
youths had now filled out into big men, even Frank
who was the slightest of the three. In their flannel
trousers and lightweight blue serge coats, with
fresh vivid faces, alive and eager, they made a
pleasing sight. And many was the approving
glance thrown at them by grizzled and tanned old-timers
whom they passed on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been duding up,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell, with a
grin. He himself in his flyer&rsquo;s uniform made a
distinguished figure.</p>
<p>The boys sank into the chairs pulled out for
them, and conversation became general as the dinner
progressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do tonight?&rdquo; asked Jack, as the
dinner neared conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about seeing the sights?&rdquo; proposed Captain
Cornell, who apparently considered himself in
the light of guide to the party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of Laredo?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;Not much to see, I
guess, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Of Mex town&mdash;of Nueva Laredo across
the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell, &ldquo;for one thing, a
sight that has vanished from our own country&mdash;the
open saloon. I gather that we are all teetotalers,
but that needn&rsquo;t bother us. An occasional
bottle of ginger ale will be our passport. Then,
too, we can toss a little change to the dance hall
girls for putting on their turns. And we can take
a look at the gambling&mdash;take a whirl, too, if you
desire. I remember once dropping a quarter in
one of those machines and turning up a full house
on the cards. Paid me five dollars,&rdquo; he concluded
reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly,&rdquo; said Jack, eyes shining, &ldquo;sounds like
the Old West&mdash;just like the days of &rsquo;49 in California.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is like the Old West&mdash;but with a difference,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;The dance halls,
saloons and gambling houses of the Old West were
operated for the recreation of a stern and hardy
breed of men. Those of Nueva Laredo, like those
of Juarez, Mexicali and Tia Juana, however, are
operated mainly for the American tourists who roll
across the Line in their motor cars. I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone slumming so often that I don&rsquo;t
care about it. But you boys may as well see what
things are like, and if Captain Cornell consents to
pilot you I don&rsquo;t see why Temple and I shouldn&rsquo;t
be permitted to stay here and take things easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Temple nodded, a look of relief in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, George,&rdquo; he said, confidentially,
&ldquo;Bob and Frank have been a trial to me. If I can
get away from them for awhile, I have no objection
to letting Captain Cornell assume the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young army flyer laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll be a poor chaperone,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo; And he rose.</p>
<p>The others pushed back their chairs and rose,
too. As they moved toward the door, a voice
hailed Captain Cornell from a side table, and he
spun about to find a huge sun-burned and grizzled
man in flannel shirt and cowboy boots rising to
greet him, showing two big revolvers at his hips
as he stood up. They talked a moment or two, the
big man&rsquo;s voice booming and Captain Cornell&rsquo;s
lower-pitched, the words of both indistinguishable.</p>
<p>After a good look at the flyer&rsquo;s companion, the
party moved on toward the lobby where presently
they were rejoined by Captain Cornell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was Jack Hannaford of the Rangers,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We fellows of the Border Patrol work together
with them a good deal. Jack has been
famous along this Border for forty years. Said
he understood that after tonight Uncle Sam is going
to close the International Bridge at 9 o&rsquo;clock
at night, after which hour any Americans in
Nueva Laredo will have to stay there until the next
day. So this will be your last chance to see what
Mex town is like at night, because you&rsquo;d be hardly
likely to care to spend the night there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Temple.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton was about to answer but Captain
Cornell forestalled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To cut down this business of Americans going
across the Line and making a wild night of it,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. It was the answer he
himself had been about to propose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry. If
the word is generally known, it&rsquo;s likely to be a big
night at Nueva Laredo, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely,&rdquo; agreed Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Excuse
me a minute, while I order a taxi.&rdquo; And he
stepped to the desk.</p>
<p>While he was absent, Mr. Temple with a look
of some anxiety lectured the youths on the necessity
for avoiding trouble in Nueva Laredo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; said Bob, a bit impatiently, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be
all right. Nothing is going to happen. Why, it&rsquo;ll
be just like Coney Island. Besides we&rsquo;re able to
take care of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; Mr. Temple snorted. &ldquo;Why, even
while I&rsquo;ve been looking at you, you&rsquo;ve gone and
got into trouble that took you a year to shake off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh. Then up came Captain
Cornell to bear the youths away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taxi&rsquo;s waiting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, good-bye.
Look for us around midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at the door he paused in sudden thought.
&ldquo;Tell that taxi to wait a bit, fellows,&rdquo; he said.
Frank obediently crossed the sidewalk and told the
driver of the rickety vehicle to wait for them.
When he returned a conversation was going on
which informed him that Captain Cornell had decided
to doff his uniform before entering Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about of a size, Captain,&rdquo; Bob was saying.
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; And he bore him away.</p>
<p>Frank turned to Jack for an explanation and was
informed Captain Cornell had decided not to wear
his uniform because it would bring undue notice in
Mexico and might induce some rowdy to start a
fight.</p>
<p>The others returned in a very short time, the
flyer attired in a companion suit to Bob&rsquo;s, and then
climbing into the taxi all four set out for the International
Bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was big,&rdquo; Captain Cornell said to
Bob, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re bigger. Certainly the coat isn&rsquo;t
too tight.&rdquo; And he flexed his arms. &ldquo;Well, here
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the taxi nosed out upon the bridge,
going at a snail&rsquo;s pace and stopping alongside of
the first official. A number of other similar stops
were made, in order to satisfy a variety of officials,
both American and Mexican. Then they rolled off
upon a narrow, rough, unpaved street lined with
little saloons. They were open-front establishments,
and from them came a glare of light and a
blare of noise. Up and down the sidewalks, under
wooden canopies, pushed and surged a noisy crowd.
Taxis and private cars sped recklessly up and down
or shot from side streets at dizzying speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;you know you&rsquo;re in a foreign
country all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Uncle Sam,&rdquo; cried Bob gaily, looking
back and waving his hand. Then a cry of
alarm burst from his throat, he leaped to his feet,
and the next moment was hurled into Jack&rsquo;s lap
as the taxi was struck from the rear with a sickening
crash and went careening drunkenly across the uneven
roadway to end up against an iron pillar supporting
a sidewalk canopy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">DON FERDINAND AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>Captain Cornell was first to emerge from the
taxi which had lost its left front wheel in the impact
against the pole and canted downward like a
ship sinking by the head. He emerged as if shot
from a cannon, for the crazy door had been
wrenched open by the shock, and he had been
tossed through the aperture. Alighting on hands
and knees, he quickly got to his feet and turned to
see how his companions fared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo; he sang out, peering inside.</p>
<p>From the heap, three muffled voices filled with
various degrees of mirth answered that their
owners were not in desperate straits, and he experienced
a sense of relief. Any or all of his
charges well might have been seriously injured.
But as he saw them struggling to untangle themselves,
he grinned through a split lip caused by his
face brushing the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for me,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have
dared face their fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Then he felt someone plucking his sleeve and
whirled about. A mixed crowd of Mexicans and
tourists drawn by the crash hemmed him in, and
over the heads of the crowd he could see several
be-spangled dance hall girls from a nearby resort
standing on tiptoe to behold.</p>
<p>The tug came from his taxi driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you hurt?&rdquo; asked the flyer, rubbing
futilely at the smudged knees of his&mdash;or, rather,
Bob&rsquo;s&mdash;white flannels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, except lost a little breath,&rdquo; said the
latter, a hardened night hawk. &ldquo;Wheel stopped
me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But, say, who pays for this? If
you don&rsquo;t wanta pony up yerself, better help me
ketch the old hombre what rammed us. There he
goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a high-powered, long-snouted
touring car of midnight blue, with shining German
silver trimmings, gleaming in the street. A uniformed
driver had just finished inspecting his car
for possible damage, and was climbing back to the
driver&rsquo;s seat. From the rear, a shrill voice in
broken English shrieked adjurations to the
chauffeur to hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old billy goat in the back&rsquo;s all excited,&rdquo; explained
the jehu. &ldquo;Been a-chasin&rsquo; somebody, I
gather, an&rsquo; rammed us in &rsquo;is hurry. Payin&rsquo; no attention
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, that won&rsquo;t do. We want an explanation,
anyhow,&rdquo; declared the army flyer, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And thrusting aside several Mexicans who stood
in his way, he made a run for the big car just as
it got into motion. The crowd stared in astonishment.
One or two tourists raised a cheer. The
jehu leaned on his tilting taxi with a sour grin
riding his features. Bob emerging from the taxi
at that moment, one hand raised to caress a considerable-sized
bump on his head, saw Captain
Cornell make a flying leap and land on the running
board of the other car, just as the chauffeur picking
up speed stepped on the gas and it leaped ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; yelled Bob.</p>
<p>But if any reply was vouchsafed by the doughty
flyer, the speed with which the big car got under
way neutralized it. Bob made a step forward into
the street in astonishment, but the jehu&rsquo;s hand on
his arm arrested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, pal,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;I wanta be paid
for me damage. Stick around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be paid. Don&rsquo;t worry.
But where did Cap&mdash;where did our friend go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jehu explained. Frank and Jack, little
worse for the accident, with the exception of minor
body bruises, joined Bob on the sidewalk, and likewise
received the benefit of the explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old fellow was in a tearin&rsquo; hurry to git some
body seems he was a-chasin&rsquo;, far as I could make
out,&rdquo; said the jehu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Cap&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; laughed Bob. &ldquo;Nothing
to do but wait.&rdquo; He gazed at the crowd surrounding
them, half a hundred or more, and sighed.
&ldquo;Worse than Fifth Avenue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess any
time an accident happens, no matter where it is, a
crowd gathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd parted to make way for a Mexican
policeman, swarthy, medium-sized, heavy-mustached,
swinging a long nightstick and with the
handles of two six-shooters protruding at his sides.
He started to question them haltingly in broken
English, but at his first words Jack addressed him
in Spanish. The policeman&rsquo;s face lighted up, and
he nodded violently as Jack continued in a voice
so low that the crowd could not hear. Then he
turned and with voice and club-thrust began to
scatter the crowd.</p>
<p>The tourists seeing the show was over, so to
speak, turned away, and the Mexican barflies
shuffled off. Finally, the crowd was dispelled, and
the policeman returned and Jack shook hands with
him gravely, only a slight twitching at the corners
of his mouth betraying to his companions that he
nursed a secret sense of amusement. Then, swinging
his stick in a jaunty salute, the policeman made
off with a &ldquo;Mil&rsquo; gracias, senor,&rdquo; to which Jack responded
with &ldquo;Buenos noches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much d&rsquo;ye give &rsquo;im?&rdquo; asked the jehu,
leering wisely and spitting into the street.</p>
<p>Jack was inclined to resent the familiarity, but
shrugged and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; The jehu shrugged. Then he straightened
out of his slouch as his roving eye caught
sight of something in the street, and he pointed.
&ldquo;Say. What d&rsquo;ye know? Bringin&rsquo; him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys gazed in the direction indicated. There
rolling up behind them was the big car which had
bumped them and which had been boarded by Captain
Cornell. They turned to it eagerly, as it rolled
to a halt at the curb. Then the biggest surprise of
all greeted them, for out stepped first Captain Cornell
and after him an even more familiar figure&mdash;at
least to Jack. The latter could hardly believe
his eyes. He halted a moment in astonishment,
then sprang forward with a cry of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ferdinand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know this hombre?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Cornell, eyes popping.</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand, for he it was, stared a moment,
then threw himself at Jack. Throwing his arms
about the big fellow, he clasped him with Latin
exuberance, then backed off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you are acquainted with this man, Senor
Jack,&rdquo; he said excitedly, pointing to Captain Cornell,
&ldquo;tell him I will pay for any damage, but he
must let me go. It is necessary. Ah, alas, though,&rdquo;
he groaned, &ldquo;I fear it is now too late. That devil
has escaped again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was bewildered. Finding Don Ferdinand
here, in Nueva Laredo, when the last heard of
him he had disappeared from his home! All he
could do was to stare in astonishment. But Don
Ferdinand who had spoken to Jack in Spanish was
wringing his hands in despair. Jack could not
understand why.</p>
<p>Bob and Frank, who had not seen the old
Spanish aristocrat for a number of years, had been
slow to recognize him. But the conversation and
Jack&rsquo;s use of the older man&rsquo;s name brought back
recollection. They crowded forward and greeted
him. He seemed like a man in a daze.</p>
<p>Then understanding suddenly came to Jack.
Don Ferdinand had declared &ldquo;that devil has escaped
again.&rdquo; The light dawned. He had been chasing
that fellow in pursuit of whom he had left home
and gone to the mine. What was his name?
Ramirez! Yes, Ramirez, that was it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Ramirez, Don Ferdinand?&rdquo; he demanded
eagerly, elbowing Bob aside to face his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh.&rdquo; Don Ferdinand put his finger to his lips.
&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; he said, low-voiced. &ldquo;He has escaped
me. But let us not talk about it here. Come, get
into my car. But first I&rsquo;ll pay this gentleman for
his taxi,&rdquo; he said, pulling out a wallet. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he
added glaring at Captain Cornell, &ldquo;he is a violent
man. He put a revolver into my face and commanded
me to order my driver to return here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized the flyer. Remembering his
conversation with Jack at the ranch regarding Don
Ferdinand and his trouble at the mine with &ldquo;that
devil Ramirez,&rdquo; he also was putting two and two
together out of the conversation between the old
aristocrat and Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, you two must be friends,&rdquo; declared
Jack, proceeding to introduce them. &ldquo;As for the
damage to the taxi&mdash;&rdquo; And leaving the sentence
unfinished, he reached for his own wallet.</p>
<p>But Don Ferdinand forestalled him. He thrust
into the jehu&rsquo;s hands a sheaf of bills the size of
which made the latter&rsquo;s eyes bulge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that sufficient?&rdquo; he snapped in English.</p>
<p>The taxi bandit made a grotesque bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that price,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the ol&rsquo; boat&rsquo;s yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand never even smiled, but beckoning
the four young fellows to follow, climbed into
his car. Bob and Frank hung back, whispering.
Then, just as Jack was about to enter behind Don
Ferdinand, they halted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack, we haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet of the
town,&rdquo; explained Frank. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;d like to. No
use running away when we just came. As for the
taxi we can always get another to take us back across
the Bridge, I guess. Explain to Don Ferdinand,
and then let the four of us knock around as we intended
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack considered, turning to Captain Cornell with
a question in his eyes. The latter nodded. He
was young enough to enjoy a sightseeing tour and,
since they had all escaped unscathed from the crash,
saw no reason to return with their original purpose
unfulfilled.</p>
<p>So Jack explained the situation to Don Ferdinand,
adding that they were staying at the Hamilton
Hotel on the American side of the River, with
Mr. Hampton and Mr. Temple. He urged that
Don Ferdinand, if he intended to return across the
River, call on those two older men&mdash;both of whom
were friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight I cannot, Jack,&rdquo; said Don Ferdinand.
&ldquo;I am staying with friends who expect me. This
is their car. But tomorrow I shall give myself the
pleasure of calling upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;as an afterthought&mdash;&ldquo;come
to the hotel before three o&rsquo;clock tomorrow
afternoon, as we all would like to come back
here to see the bull fight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The old Don agreed to do so. Then with a bow
all around, he gave the word to his chauffeur, and
the latter pulled out into the street, backed
and headed for the International Bridge.</p>
<p>Jack stood at the curb, gazing thoughtfully after
the departing car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder what brought him here, and I
wonder about this mysterious Mr. Ramirez,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>He had told Bob and Frank before dinner about
the mysterious events transpiring at Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
mine and about the latter&rsquo;s disappearance.
Captain Cornell likewise knew. So Jack&rsquo;s remark
was understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll find out tomorrow,&rdquo; said big Bob,
stretching. &ldquo;Come on, lads. Let&rsquo;s saunter a bit
and take in the sights. There&rsquo;s a hot dog stand
just ahead here, and I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat a
kennel. That little bounce seems to have given me
an appetite. Step up, me byes, and order your dogs,
with mustard or without.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Sleepy-eyed still after their late hours of the
night before, the boys met at a belated eleven
o&rsquo;clock breakfast in the dining room of the hotel
next morning. While they were dressing the Sunday
morning church bells had been ringing in their
ears. At the table, Bob reported that his father
and Mr. Hampton had departed to attend church
services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried to get me to go along,&rdquo; said Bob, who
was first of the boys to arise, &ldquo;but I wanted to
wait around for you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth to tell, Bob had had a hard time persuading
his father that it would be all right for them
to attend the bull fight in the Mexican town across
the Border that afternoon. Mr. Temple was what
would be termed an old-fashioned man. To him
attendance at a bull fight under any circumstances
was to be frowned on. And Sunday attendance
was little short of a sin. However, the youths
were now at the age of discretion, he pointed out,
and could do as they pleased. Bob had pointed
out that, inasmuch as bull fights were not held except
on a Sunday, this would be their only opportunity
to behold one. Then the matter had been
dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was some night,&rdquo; said Jack, between
bites of grape fruit. &ldquo;Wonder when Don Ferdinand
will show up and, likewise, what sort of story
he will have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be exciting,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Think
of your finding him here, on the trail of that fellow&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramirez,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over the feeling,
fellows, that we&rsquo;re in for a bit of excitement
through our acquaintance with Don Ferdinand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shucks,&rdquo; yawned big Bob, stretching his
arms widely. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;ll happen. Nothing ever
does happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank looked at him, grinning. &ldquo;You mean to
say nothing ever happens to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my story,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll stick to
it. Oh, we&rsquo;ve had a few little adventures in our
lives, but that day&rsquo;s gone. What&rsquo;s there left?
Now that we&rsquo;ve graduated, we&rsquo;ll have to settle down
in business. Pretty soon some girl&rsquo;ll come along
and marry us, and then we&rsquo;ll be raising families
and paying taxes and pew rent. Then we&rsquo;ll be getting
fatter and fatter, and pretty soon some kid&rsquo;ll
say: &lsquo;Him? Oh, he used to be in the backfield for
Yale&mdash;but that was a long time ago.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Jack and Frank gazed in amused astonishment
at their big comrade, and then as if with one accord
burst into a hearty laugh. Bob&rsquo;s drooping expression
did not change, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh, doggone ye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Dad&rsquo;s been
talking to me like a father this morning. Said
last night&rsquo;s little ruckus convinced him I ought to
come to my senses and settle down. First thing
you know, I&rsquo;ll be sitting in an office and learning
the export trade. No, I mean it. Nothing&rsquo;s ever
going to happen to us again&mdash;to me, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bellboy came through the lobby calling. He
poked his head in the doorway, looked around, saw
only the three at table, and was about to withdraw,
but thought better of it. Maybe the man he wanted
was in that group. He&rsquo;d give one call, anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mis-ter Hamp-ton,&rdquo; he droned. &ldquo;Mis-ter
Hamp-ton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Jack leaped startled to his feet. &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bellboy advanced, holding out a telegram in
a yellow envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be for your father,&rdquo; suggested Frank.</p>
<p>Jack took it and read the typewritten superscription.
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>He handed the bellboy a tip, and the latter turned
away. Then Jack slit open the envelope, drew out
the telegram and read it. The next moment, he
whirled to his companions, throwing the message
down on the table between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum. Read that. Then say nothing exciting
is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With quickened interest, Bob and Frank put
their heads together and bent to read. This is
what they saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do not look for me today. Important developments.
Thousand pardons.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;F.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They looked up puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F. must be Don Ferdinand,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Now
d&rsquo;you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can see is that he says he can&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>Jack punched him disgustedly. &ldquo;Wake up, Bob.
If important developments have occurred, it can
only have to do with this fellow Ramirez. Don
Ferdinand was after him last night, when he
smashed into our taxi and was so delayed that he
lost him. Now the old fire-eater has got track of
Ramirez again and is going after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that got to do with us?&rdquo; grumbled
Bob, whose pessimism this morning was too deep
to be quickly dispelled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob, don&rsquo;t be so gloomy,&rdquo; said Frank, his
quick eager face alight. &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s right. I seem to
smell excitement, and I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;re going
to get into it some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I feel, too,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
going on, something big, or else old Don
Ferdinand wouldn&rsquo;t be here. He&rsquo;s trailed Ramirez
more than two hundred miles&mdash;probably on horseback.
He had a dozen armed men at his back when
he started. Probably they&rsquo;re somewhere around.
Something&rsquo;s going to happen. I don&rsquo;t know what.
I can&rsquo;t even guess. But I&rsquo;ll bet we get into it.
Come on, you&rsquo;ve finished breakfast. Let&rsquo;s get outside
and get some air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing back their chairs, the others rose and
followed him into the lobby. As they started for
the elevator in order to ascend to their rooms and
get their hats preparatory to taking a stroll about
Laredo, Captain Cornell espied them. He was in
civilian clothes&mdash;but this time, his own. Crossing
the lobby he joined them, and all four went up to
the sitting room of their suite.</p>
<p>Jack told the flyer of Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s telegram,
advancing his explanation of it.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell displayed a quickened interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Told you I was going to try and find out something
about this fellow Ramirez,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well,
this morning I bumped into Jack Hannaford on my
way here. Nobody knows anything about Ramirez,
out at the field, by the way. But Jack&rsquo;s an
old-timer. Used to be a Ranger. He&rsquo;s the same
man who told me last night that the government
was about to close the International Bridge at nine
o&rsquo;clock at night hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ramirez?&rsquo; said Hannaford, &lsquo;Ramirez?&rsquo; He
looked thoughtful. &lsquo;Would he be a little fellow
now, with blue powder burns on the left cheek an&rsquo;
a hooked nose like a poll parrot an&rsquo; a limp in &rsquo;is
right leg?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laughed. &lsquo;How do I know what he looks like
when I&rsquo;ve never seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jack, not one bit phased by my remark,
&lsquo;yes,&rsquo; that would be him. An&rsquo; what would
ye be after wantin&rsquo; with Ramirez? He&rsquo;s a bad
hombre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I gathered that much,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t
want to find him. Somebody else does, though.
So he&rsquo;s a bad hombre, Jack? How bad? Is he a
Mexican revolutionist?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Revolutionist?&rsquo; snorts Hannaford. &lsquo;No, he
ain&rsquo;t no petty bandit callin&rsquo; himself a General. He&rsquo;s
a bigger crook than that. Why, he&rsquo;s the biggest
crook on the Border by all odds. Government&rsquo;s
been after him for twenty years, but never could
get the goods on him. You know all about him.
Why d&rsquo;ye ask me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Crook?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;How come, Hannaford?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Smuggler,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I did get excited, fellows. It all came
back to me. I remembered the name. When you
first mentioned it, Jack, back there at your home it
sounded familiar. But like you I got to thinking
of revolutionists. That put me off the track. So
now I said to Hannaford, &lsquo;Look here. You mean
the Master Mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannaford snorted again. &lsquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s what
the newspapers call him. But he ain&rsquo;t any Master
Mind. He&rsquo;s just a doggone smart crook. But he&rsquo;ll
get his some day. I only hope it&rsquo;s on this side of
the Line, so I can get a crack at him. His gang
croaked my old side-kick, years ago. Just the same,
you&rsquo;ll have to admit he is smart. Why, he fools
you boys of the Border Patrol in your airplanes
just as easy as he used to fool us when we chased
him on horseback. He&rsquo;s smuggled everything
from Chinamen to diamonds in his time. What
he&rsquo;s up to now, I don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;re the first
that&rsquo;s mentioned him in a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then I asked Jack if that was true, if he
hadn&rsquo;t heard any rumors of recent activity on the
part of Ramirez, and he said he hadn&rsquo;t. We talked
a little more, and then I came on here. Thought
this much would be interesting, anyhow, and that
your friend Don Ferdinand might complete
the picture. Now here you get a telegram
which as good as says he&rsquo;s on Ramirez&rsquo;s track
once more. Nothing to do but wait I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>And the flyer subsided.</p>
<p>He had contributed real news, however. And
their plans for a stroll forgotten, the four talked
on until the subject had been exhausted.</p>
<p>Then the conversation turned to Jack&rsquo;s radio experiments,
and Captain Cornell, who was really interested
despite his humorous lamentation that he
couldn&rsquo;t understand anything at all about the subject,
asked numerous questions which Jack was
kept busy answering.</p>
<p>Presently, acting on a sudden thought, Frank
got up and unlocked a trunk. Delving into it, he
reappeared with a small square box. This he placed
on a table with an air of triumph, and throwing
open the lid stepped back, gesturing like a showman,
and said: &ldquo;Behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like some kind of a radio set,&rdquo; said Jack,
examining the contents. &ldquo;And here, strapped in
the lid, is a head-piece. Looks like radio, tastes
like radio, must be radio. What is it, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what you said. Only it&rsquo;s a trick set.
Had a little time last Winter, and got to playing
with an idea. Here, I&rsquo;ll show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And carefully removing the whole business from
the box, Frank proudly held it up for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell, &ldquo;it looks like some
kind of a belt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just what it is,&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a radio receiving set for hikers. It contains
three &lsquo;peanut&rsquo; tubes, Jack. See? And A and B batteries.
I snap it around my waist. Like this.
See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was. A complete receiving set. Around
the bottom of the broad belt ran a shelf bracketed
at right angle, and on it were the batteries, the
three little tubes, and the various dials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Frank, pointing, &ldquo;I hook on the
head-phone. As for aerial, this little loop turns
the trick.&rdquo; Lifting out what seemed to be the bottom
of the cabinet, he disclosed a tiny loop beneath,
laid in a shallow drawer. &ldquo;And, Jack, you think
you&rsquo;re some punkins with your experiments in long-distance
receptivity. Well, how far do you think
I can receive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up,&rdquo; said Jack, laughing. &ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three hundred miles,&rdquo; Frank replied.
&ldquo;Pretty good, eh, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly is,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let me try it. Maybe,
someone is broadcasting now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I took a look at the
local paper this morning and read the broadcasting
program. Nothing on until 4 o&rsquo;clock. And by then
we&rsquo;ll be at the bull fight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Take it along, and we&rsquo;ll
try it there. I want to know whether it&rsquo;ll work.
If it does, we ought to get some fun out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank promised to do so, and the set was replaced
in the box. Then Mr. Hampton and Mr.
Temple returned, and the matter was forgotten in
the more important matter of explaining Don
Ferdinand&rsquo;s telegram and repeating what Captain
Cornell had learned about Ramirez from the former
Ranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope nothing has happened to my old friend,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hampton thoughtfully. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t give the
address of the friends he&rsquo;s staying with, did he,
Jack? No? Well, we can&rsquo;t look him up there,
then. Some rich Mexican family living on the
American side of the Border, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be rich, all right,&rdquo; agreed Captain Cornell.
&ldquo;That car and the liveried chauffeur both
spelled ready money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;nothing for us to
do then except to wait. We&rsquo;ll hear from Don
Ferdinand sooner or later. But I do hope he
doesn&rsquo;t endanger himself, if only for the sake of
his daughter.&rdquo; He looked sidelong at Jack, but the
latter appeared elaborately unconscious of this
mention of Rafaela. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Hampton,
then, &ldquo;I hate to appear to be getting old, but
this heat certainly makes me feel sleepy. Run
along, you fellows, until time to go down into
Nueva Laredo. I&rsquo;m going to take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE BULL FIGHT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Better come with us, Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Face beaded with perspiration because of the
steaming heat, Mr. Hampton stood by the bed on
which his companion, partially disrobed, had
thrown himself. The draught created by the electric
fan blew across him. Mr. Temple shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a million dollars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly
comfortable here, and I know I wouldn&rsquo;t be so at
the bull fight. Besides, you know what I think of
bull fights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. He was well aware that
his friend frowned upon the proposed jaunt into
Mexico that afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t forbid the
boys to go. They&rsquo;re too old for that. Besides
that&rsquo;s not the way to inculcate principles, anyhow.
Furthermore, you have the wrong idea of bull
fights, in a way. To these Mexicans a bull fight is
just the same as a baseball game to Americans.
Remember, I know the Latin temperament.&rdquo; He
paused, looking down a moment, thoughtfully, at
his companion. &ldquo;The boys are young, Temple.
When we were their age, the prospects of a bull
fight would have appealed to us, too. Well&rdquo;&mdash;turning
with a resigned sigh toward the door&mdash;&ldquo;it certainly
doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me, but I reckon I shall
have to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once more wiping his perspiring face, Mr.
Hampton went out, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>He found the three youths and Captain Cornell
awaiting him in the steaming lobby, and all four
went out and climbed into a waiting taxi, whence
they proceeded toward the International Bridge.</p>
<p>Other automobiles were streaming across the
Bridge. The bull fight was to be of more than
customary interest, for two famous matadors were
to display their prowess in opposition to each other.
One was Juan Salento, idol of Mexico, and the
other, Estramadura, famous Spanish matador,
who, fresh from triumphs in Madrid, was touring
Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Through the crowded, dusty, ill-paved streets
of Nueva Laredo went the taxi. The crowd grew
denser. On the sidewalks, a pushing, jostling,
eager mass of Mexicans with a thick sprinkling of
Americans. Boys running in the streets, barefoot,
ragged, dark, darting in and out between automobiles.
Several times the hearts of the party
were in their mouths as little shavers seemed to
escape being run over merely by a hair&rsquo;s breadth.
Motor cars shot by them or darted from side streets
with reckless disregard, but fortunately no accidents
occurred, although time and again the members
of the party expected to hear sounds of a
crash.</p>
<p>As they neared the huge amphitheatre, Captain
Cornell ordered the taxi driver to drive to the shady
entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the shady side it costs four dollars a seat,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;On the sunny side it costs two. A big
difference&mdash;but it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They disembarked, passed through the gate in
the middle of a swarming crowd, and then mounted
to the topmost tier of seats.</p>
<p>Under the midafternoon sun the huge amphitheatre
was literally baking. Heat waves shimmered
above the sandy arena in the middle. Yet more
than ten thousand people were already seated in the
banked-up tiers of seats, while others were crowding
up by every stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the colors,&rdquo; commented Jack. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know there were that many in existence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The peons on every hand were, in truth, arrayed
as the lilies of the field&mdash;in the most gorgeous raiment
they possessed. They were out to make holiday,
and they were dressed for the part. The tiers,
under the glaring sun, looked like a vast flower
display.</p>
<p>While the others were busied gazing here and
there upon the strange and unfamiliar scene, and
laughing at the many laughable incidents which kept
constantly coming to their attention, Frank quietly
went about a certain task. He had brought with
him his receiving set on a belt. He opened up the
box in which it was arranged, took it out, buckled
it on, adjusted the headphones, and then hooked
up to the little loop aerial. Sitting as he did on the
top row of seats, with none behind him, and flanked
on either side by other members of his party, he
was unobserved by outsiders.</p>
<p>Jack and Bob on one side, Captain Cornell and
Mr. Hampton on the other, were all craning forward,
gazing at the scene below, and paying him
no attention.</p>
<p>For a little while, until his adjustments were
made, Frank fiddled with the dials. Then, assured
that everything was in good working order, he
leaned back, preparing to listen to whatever was in
the air.</p>
<p>Presently Jack looked around as if to address
some remark to him and for the first time noticed
what Frank was doing. He began to laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Coming to a bull
fight, and paying it no attention, but preparing, instead,
to listen in on some broadcasting program.
Hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank took off the headphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, in a disappointed tone, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t
a thing in the air except some Morse. And I&rsquo;m so
rusty, I can&rsquo;t make it out. Want to listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stretched out a hand to take the headphones,
but at that moment Bob plucked his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come, fellows. Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both youths lost any further interest in radio as
they gazed into the arena below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Estramadura, the tall one in red,&rdquo; explained
Captain Cornell, pointing. &ldquo;And the little
fellow in yellow is Juan Salento. Listen to the
yells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild cheering broke from the stands as the procession
made its preliminary circle of the arena.
First came the two famous matadors. They were
followed at a little distance by the eight toreadors,
marching four abreast. Four picadors on horseback
followed, blunt spears erect. Last of all
came a boy driving a team of mules. And in all
the world there was nobody so swollen with importance
as that boy.</p>
<p>Laughingly, Mr. Hampton called attention to the
lad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;His job is to haul out the dead bulls,&rdquo; explained
Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Every Mexican boy in the
audience would give his right eye to be in that
boy&rsquo;s place. Many a famous matador has risen
from just such an apprenticeship, and some day that
boy may be the idol of the populace. Who
knows? Certainly, you can count on it that he
thinks he&rsquo;ll become a great man some day. Probably,
he has a wooden sword, and practices the
matador&rsquo;s strokes continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the box occupied by the Mexican general
commanding the garrison, the matadors made their
bow. Then the boy with the two mules retreated,
the picadors on horseback drew behind a barricade
between the front tier of seats and the arena, the
toreadors with their capes scattered about the arena,
and Estramadura who was to kill the first bull
lounged by himself with a bored air.</p>
<p>On the topmost tier of seats on the shady side,
five Americans leaned forward almost as interested&mdash;yet
not quite&mdash;as the thousands of Mexicans
about them. All that had gone before was merely
a flourish. The drama was now about to begin.
Even the band, seated on a box near that of the
commandant, ceased blowing its horns and thumping
its drums.</p>
<p>A door in the fence opened.</p>
<p>A huge black bull charged into the arena.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>A moment the black bull stood with head down,
nostrils quivering, eyes flashing. Then he charged&mdash;straight
toward the nearest toreador. The man
waited until the bull was perilously close, then
flaunting his long cape in front of the charging
animal, leaped nimbly aside.</p>
<p>The bull became more enraged. This way and that
he charged. Toreadors whipped their capes across
his eyes.</p>
<p>He became more accustomed to their tricks.
The last three toreadors were so hard-pressed that
they were compelled to seek shelter by leaping over
the stout plank wall into the runway separating the
lowest tiers of seats from the arena.</p>
<p>Hysterical yelps of laughter bespoke the tenseness
to which the crowd was working itself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estramadura&rsquo;s turn now,&rdquo; shouted Captain
Cornell to his companions, raising his voice in
order to make himself heard above the sudden roar
of applause.</p>
<p>The tall graceful Spaniard, clad all in red&mdash;red
shoes, red stockings, red silk knee breeches, red
jacket, with a broad yellow sash and jaunty, tri-cornered
yellow cap, strolled lazily forth.</p>
<p>But he was not so lazy as his actions bespoke.
Or, if lazy, was nimble. Not for him the shelter of
working near the wall. He moved to the middle
of the arena. The bull charged for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The three youths sucked in their breath.
Would he let himself be gored? How would he
meet that charge? He was weaponless. The only
thing he held in his hands was a voluminous red
cape.</p>
<p>The matador flicked out the cape with the merest
movement of his hands, as a boy flicks forth a
marble. But that little movement sent the cape
fluttering wide before the eyes of the bull.</p>
<p>Yet Estramadura did not budge. He seemed
rooted in the sand. The bull bellowed, lowered his
head, charged on.</p>
<p>By a sideways twist of his body, indescribably
graceful, Estramadura avoided the nearest horn of
the maddened animal by an inch, and the brute
thundered on. The matador had not moved his
feet.</p>
<p>A thunderous cheer shook the stands. Men
leaped to their feet in a frenzy. Hats were flung
into the ring. Money fell gleaming upon the arena
sand.</p>
<p>Turning his back on the bull, Estramadura
bowed. And as if their former efforts were but a
mere warming-up process, the spectators released
another volley of cheers far greater in volume.</p>
<p>The boys sat enthralled, uttering occasional
ejaculations, not particularly intended to be heard
and going unanswered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Graceful as a snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some cheering, Bob. Beats the old football
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bull had turned, was coming back. Again
Estramadura awaited him. Out whipped the cape,
falling over the animal&rsquo;s head, turning him around
for another charge. Estramadura did not shift his
feet an inch.</p>
<p>Indescribably graceful he seemed, out there,
under that blazing sun, every action etched on the
retina of the onlookers. The bull charged again.
Then Estramadura lifting his tri-cornered silk cap
reached over and hung it on one of the animal&rsquo;s
horns&mdash;without moving from his position.</p>
<p>It was the wildest kind of daring, the utmost
display of skill. And in the yell of frenzied acclaim
which went up was mingled many an American
as well as Mexican voice.</p>
<p>Then, as if at a signal from the matador, a
picador dashed forward on horseback, blunt spear
leveled, and took and turned aside the bull&rsquo;s next
charge. That gave the nearest toreador time to
get into the game once more, and he diverted the
animal with his cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Captain,&rdquo; called Jack, leaning across
Frank who intervened, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the matador going
now&mdash;that daring fellow in red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estramadura was moving toward the fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to get his sword,&rdquo; replied the army
flyer. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;ll give the bull the coup-de-grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An attendant respectfully tendered the weapon
on a cushion. Estramadura took it, bent it into an
arch between his hands, then released the point and
the weapon sprang back. Flinging his cape over
the sword, the matador strolled gracefully back
into the center of the arena.</p>
<p>Toreadors and picadors had left. Only the two
opponents&mdash;the huge black bull and the slender
figure in red&mdash;were left in the arena.</p>
<p>Once more the bull charged his tormentor, and
now Estramadura essayed a manoeuvre which sent
the stands into positive hysteria. Waiting until
the animal was almost upon him, he turned his
back nonchalantly, at the same time swaying to one
side. And the bull went thundering by so close that
it seemed he brushed the man.</p>
<p>Back he came. And Estramadura, tossing the
cloak at length aside, stood with right leg advanced,
right arm extended with the sword,
measuring his stroke. He was like a great drop
of blood against the yellow background of the sand.
The sunlight on his blade turned it into a ribbon
of fire.</p>
<p>The bull charged. One short sharp &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; of
irrepressible excitement ran through the whole vast
audience. Then silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>This time Estramadura moved. He leaped aside
and thrust downward through the shoulder. The
bull fell as if stricken by a thunderbolt in mid
career, and did not move. The matador&rsquo;s sword
had pierced his heart.</p>
<p>Then while the stands literally went wild, and
the peons, aristocrats and Americans thumped each
other hysterically on the back, yelled themselves
hoarse and vied with each other in tossing money
into the arena, the three youths on the topmost tier
looked at each other. Their faces were flushed, eyes
shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought a bull fight was a terrible sight,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;But could anything be more graceful or
daring than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the uproar Captain Cornell, leaning close,
made himself heard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the best in all
Spain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That means, probably, the best
in the world. The Mexican just can&rsquo;t be up to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they did not get the opportunity to find out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">RAMIREZ!</span></h2>
<p>Estramadura was enjoying his triumph to the
full. Bowing this way and that, a slender, graceful
figure, looking in his red costume like a flash of fire
against the sun-drenched yellow sands of the arena
and the colorful stands beyond, he showed no disposition
to retire so long as the ovation continued.
And the hysterically delighted Mexicans apparently
did not intend to subside so long as they had breath
to cheer.</p>
<p>Minute after minute rolled by while the uproar
continued and, if anything, grew in volume. All
about and below the little group of Americans on
the topmost tier of seats on the shady side of the
arena were men and women who apparently had
become temporarily insane. At least, so their
actions would seem to indicate. They threw their
arms about each other in true Latin abandon. They
sent straw sombreros sailing out. Some fell in the
arena, others on the heads of those below, and when
the latter accident occurred it merely tended to
heighten the general excitement. Silver pieces of
various denominations spouted up and out from the
crowded stands to go whirling and sparkling in the
sunshine and fall to the floor of the arena where
Estramadura&rsquo;s attendants scurried hither and
thither, retrieving this largess of his worshippers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Doubtless, somewhere in the background waited
Juan Salento, champion matador of Mexico. But
he was not in evidence. And doubtless he was saying
to himself that he would have to produce a
sterling performance, indeed, in order to bear comparison
with the daring and skill of this invader
from Spain. But not a cry was as yet raised for
him, not a voice as yet pleaded for a resumption of
the program. The populace still thrilled to Estramadura&rsquo;s
deeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they ever stop?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Hampton
of the army flyer. So tremendous was the tumult
that, even though there was none behind them, and
they were above the uproar, he had to bend close and
raise his voice in order to make himself heard.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell started to make some laughing
response, but while he was in the midst of it he felt
a sharp tug of his arm. They were all standing up
in order to see above the heads of those below them
who likewise had risen to their feet and, in many
cases had climbed upon the seats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Turning he saw the tug had been given by Frank,
who was staring past him to attract Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the matter? The fight got you excited,
too?&rdquo; he demanded, noting the flush of excitement
on Frank&rsquo;s cheeks and the glitter in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack wants you two to look. Down there, two
rows below us and to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank was shouting, although bending close to the
pair on his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that&rsquo;s your cook&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;Ramon,
Mr. Hampton. And he has an idea, Captain,
that the man with him is Ramirez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; cried Captain Cornell,
staring.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s eye had picked out Ramon,
and in a word or two he directed the flyer so that the
latter likewise saw.</p>
<p>Ramon was a true Mexican. Like his neighbors
he had cast restraint aside under the fever engendered
by the recent exhibition in the arena below,
and he was standing up, cheering himself hoarse.</p>
<p>Having once located the old cook, the flyer&rsquo;s
glance passed on to the man on Ramon&rsquo;s left. His
gaze narrowed. Then he gave a sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean that&rsquo;s Ramirez?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Hampton, who had been watching his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed the flyer. &ldquo;I never
saw Ramirez. But I&rsquo;d say that that man certainly
answers the description of the so-called &lsquo;Master
Mind&rsquo; which Jack Hannaford, the old Ranger, gave
me. Blue marks on his cheek as if from powder
burns and a nose beaked like a parrot&rsquo;s. If I could
only see him walk now, and see whether he has a
limp of the right leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All five stared intently at the unconscious pair who
continued to whoop it up along with the rest of their
compatriots, as if they had no thought in the world
except to do honor to the Spanish matador. But
there is something compelling in the concentrated
gaze upon the back of one&rsquo;s head of even one individual,
something which frequently compels the
object of such attentions to face the quarter whence
the stare emanates. How much more compelling,
then, if five persons fix their minds and thoughts
upon one poor human target! It was so with Ramon.</p>
<p>Suddenly he faced about a puzzled frown on his
features. His eyes roamed this way and that, as if
searching. They passed unrecognizingly over the
faces of the flyer and of Bob and Frank. But then
they lighted up with recognition as they fell first
upon Jack and then upon his father. With recognition
and with something more. What was it?
Fear?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>At any rate, Ramon suddenly turned back, gripped
his companion by an arm and began to address him.
His words, of course, could not be heard by the
watchers above him, but that he was talking about
them there could be no manner of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, suddenly, leaning
forward to call to his father. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s recognized you
and me. Duck, the rest of you. Let Ramirez see
only us when he looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such a tone of command in Jack&rsquo;s voice
that instinctively his listeners obeyed. They had
only to sink back into their seats to be protected from
the burning gaze of Ramirez by the figures of those
standing up in their seats in the row between them,
should the renegade turn around. And turn around
he did, a moment later, thus justifying Jack&rsquo;s precaution.</p>
<p>Obviously unwilling to face again the gaze of the
Hamptons whom he had left in the lurch when he
deserted their desert household, Ramon, nevertheless,
faced about along with Ramirez. That he did so
at the latter&rsquo;s command was plain to be seen, for
Ramirez gripped the older man by an arm. Ramon
indicated his former employers, then dropped his
gaze. Not so Ramirez, however, whose deep eyes
stared boldly, insolently, as if he sought to engrave
the features of the Hamptons in his memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Jack and his father withstood the scrutiny, which
lasted only a moment, and, in fact, did a bit of
staring in return. The face of the renegade was a
mask of evil. Once seen, it would not soon be forgotten,
Jack for one felt assured. And he congratulated
himself on his forethought in persuading
his companions to drop out of sight before Ramirez
turned that camera-like eye upon them. Otherwise
Ramirez would have been able to recognize them
all again. And Jack had a feeling that somebody
was going to be needed to keep an eye on this fellow,
as soon as the crowd in the arena broke up and they
all took their departure.</p>
<p>That Ramirez would wait until the ending of the
event he did not question. What was his surprise,
therefore, to see the latter face about and, gripping
Ramon by an arm, start to make his way through
the crowded stand toward the nearest stairway exit.</p>
<p>Jack and his father looked at each other. Their
thought was the same. Ramirez and Ramon should
be followed. But for either of them to shadow the
precious pair would be foolish, inasmuch as they
were known. Somebody else, someone of their
companions, would have to play detective, if the
others were to be kept in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The cheering continued. They were as much
alone in that mass of frenzied Mexicans as if on a
desert island, so far as any recognition of their
presence extended. For Jack to have questioned his
father would have been perfectly safe. Nobody
would have overheard who it was not intended
should overhear. But spoken words were unnecessary.
A question was asked and answered in glances
alone.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Hampton bent down and addressed the
flyer, acquainting him in a few brief words with the
fact that Ramon and Ramirez were leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know both Jack and me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so it
would be useless for us to follow them. But I&rsquo;m
worried about my friend Don Ferdinand. These
men may know something about him. At least we
ought not to let them get out of our sight, if we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell did not wait for further words.
He climbed up on the seat and prepared to make his
way along it toward the stairway. A quick glance
showed him Ramirez and Ramon attempting to
thrust their way toward the same destination, and
making heavy going of it because of the densely
packed mass of humanity that intervened. Another
swift appraisal brought out the fact that he would
be able to reach the stairway well ahead of them, in
all likelihood, inasmuch as all the occupants of the
topmost row of seats were standing up, thus leaving
the bench free for him to walk on, with no interference
such as Ramirez and Ramon were experiencing
from another row of persons above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of trouble,&rdquo; warned Mr. Hampton
anxiously, and the flyer laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be waiting
at the hotel to hear from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Border Patrol man darted away along the
bench, hastening so as to accomplish his purpose
before the occupants resumed their seats, Bob who
was the last in line of the party swung up behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Army can&rsquo;t get all the fun,&rdquo; he chuckled,
brushing aside the restraining hand which Jack instinctively
thrust out to halt him.</p>
<p>A moment later he was too far away to be
dragged back, and all his companions could do was
to stare after him with mouths open in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, Frank,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton suddenly,
making a dive for Frank. The latter had
attempted to climb up on the seat and set off in
pursuit of his big pal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Mr. Hampton,&rdquo; begged Frank, &ldquo;be a
Sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two will be plenty for the job,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
wish Bob hadn&rsquo;t gone, and I&rsquo;d have stopped him if
I could. I hope no trouble comes of it. And I suppose
Bob will be all right, because Captain Cornell
can get help by making his rank known, in case the
necessity of an appeal to the Mexican police arises.
Nevertheless, I won&rsquo;t be comfortable until I hear
from Bob and the army man again. And I&rsquo;d feel
even more uncomfortable if you had gone, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; protested Frank. &ldquo;I can take care
of myself as well as Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;The
truth is you probably can take care of yourself better
than Bob, that is you think a bit faster. I didn&rsquo;t
mean to hurt your feelings. But, there. Cornell
and Bob, as you see, have reached the stairway and
disappeared down it, while Ramirez and Ramon are
still ten or twelve feet distant and held up by the
crowd. That&rsquo;s good. Our boys will be able to wait
for them outside, and should manage to follow them
without arousing suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of Don Ferdinand, Dad,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;And so were you, I could tell. I wonder
now whether Ramirez is really mixed up with the
Don&rsquo;s failure to keep his appointment with us today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say he was,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Remember that
telegram spoke of &lsquo;important developments&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. &ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s why I
thought it would be wise for Cornell to trail those
two rascals. But I can&rsquo;t help wishing that Bob
hadn&rsquo;t gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too late to be mended now,&rdquo; said Jack,
practically. &ldquo;There. Ramirez and Ramon also
have reached the stairway. There, they have started
down. It&rsquo;s a good thing Bob and Captain Cornell
were so situated that they managed to get down
first. It certainly will make matters easier for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. &ldquo;Yes, and a good thing
they got away when they did, for, see, the crowd is
beginning to subside at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys gazed below them at the stands. Many
still shouted, but large sections were desisting and
beginning to sink back into their seats. As for
Estramadura, the matador, he had disappeared. The
corpse of the slain bull likewise had been removed
while their attention was otherwise engaged, without
their having been aware of what was transpiring
in the arena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I expect this other matador, the Mexican,
Juan Salento, will have his chance to show his
prowess,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;Well, I suppose we
may as well see it out. We&rsquo;d have a hard time leaving
now, anyhow, for once the next bull fight begins
it would be much as our lives would be worth to
try to pass in front of these fellows in making our
way to the exit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They resumed their seats, and Jack leaning over
the parapet behind them searched the ground far below
for signs of his companions or their quarry but
without success. The exit was hidden from his
view. Then he turned back to Frank and seeing the
latter&rsquo;s woe-begone expression he burst into a laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, old thing,&rdquo; he said, slapping Frank on
the back. &ldquo;I feel just as bad about being left behind
as you. But what must be, must. We&rsquo;ll have our
chance yet, never fear. I feel in my bones that
something is going on that spells action for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">COMMANDEERED.</span></h2>
<p>Bob and Captain Cornell bounded down the long
stairway at a breakneck pace, but one which, fortunately,
did not succeed in mishap, and emerging
upon a rutted dirt roadway on the shaded side of
the huge amphitheatre, paused to catch breath and
take their bearings.</p>
<p>Through the lucky circumstance of having been
on the topmost row of seats, they had been enabled
to reach the stairway ahead of Ramirez and Ramon.
They had brushed by the guard at the head
of the stairs without that barefooted swarthy devotee
of the bull fight even being aware of their
departure.</p>
<p>The army man was first to reach the outside,
and he was taking a rapid survey of the surroundings
when Bob came to a halt beside him. Big Bob
was still chuckling over the neat way in which he
had managed to take a hand in the adventure, knowing
well that a moment more and Mr. Hampton
would have laid on him an injunction to stay which
he would not have cared to disobey, and fully and
keenly aware, besides, that right now Jack and
Frank were filled with envy of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>What they saw was a broad straggling roadway
encircling the amphitheatre which stood on the
edge of town. The last houses of Nueva Laredo
lay to their left and some distance away, too far
to afford cover in case they wanted to hide while
spying on the movements of the two Mexicans who
any moment would appear behind them.</p>
<p>Across the roadway, however, were parked hundreds
of automobiles whose owners, Americans and
Mexicans, were somewhere in the crowd watching
the bull fight. Captain Cornell&rsquo;s roving glance fell
on these cars, and he made a quick decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raced diagonally toward the parked cars, running
toward the right in order to get out of the
range of vision of anyone descending the stairs.</p>
<p>First casting a quick glance behind him and noting
that Ramirez and Ramon had not yet come into
view, Bob followed. Captain Cornell ducked in
behind the first of the cars, a disreputable member
of a universally known family, and halted. Bob
was hard on his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Bob, with a laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Without waiting for the other&rsquo;s reply he ran an
appraising eye over the parked cars. They presented
a far different sight from an orderly automobile
park in any American city, for they were
scattered about the uneven hummocky surface of
a sandy field in what looked like inextricable confusion.
Nor were any caretakers in sight. As a
matter of fact, all male human beings and a good
many of the other sex who were anywhere near
that amphitheatre were inside of it. Who cared to
watch automobiles when he could watch a bull fight,
instead!</p>
<p>At that moment a renewed outburst of cheering
signalized the advent in the arena of the bull which
Juan Salento would be called on to fight, and big
Bob heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, listen to that. Did we come out here on
a wild goose chase? I don&rsquo;t believe those two rascals
are going to appear, after all. And we&rsquo;ll go
and miss the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hardly had he completed his lament than
Captain Cornell&rsquo;s warning voice ordered him to
stoop below the side of the car, and Bob crouched
down. None too soon, if he wanted to escape being
seen, for two figures emerged from the exit and
stood looking about. There was no mistaking
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Bob was too busy watching through eyes which
just topped the side of the car that hid him from
view, to talk. He wondered what they would do,
but was not long left in doubt. Apparently satisfied,
after a long look behind him up the stairway,
that he was not for the moment pursued, Ramirez
started to cross the road.</p>
<p>He did not head directly toward the position
where the two Americans crouched in hiding, but,
instead, made an almost straight line from the exit.
This enabled the two in hiding to keep the body of
the car between them. Ramirez would reach the
parked cars, however, not twenty-five feet away.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell did some rapid thinking. How
to keep his quarry in sight would be a problem if,
as he suspected, Ramirez got into his own car. The
two Mexicans would drive off, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; whispered Bob, &ldquo;if they have a car here,
we&rsquo;ll be out of luck, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we steal one and follow. This flivver
right here isn&rsquo;t locked. And you can start her
battery with almost any old key,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; approved the army man. &ldquo;We may
have to do that very thing. Some poor devil would
be out a car, but, of course, we could square that.
And there&rsquo;s not much chance,&rdquo; he added, thinking
fast, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d discover his loss and start the police
on our track before the end of the bull fight. By
which time we ought to be all right, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; Bob whispered,
disregarding the other&rsquo;s remarks. He raised his
head a trifle, cautiously, staring toward Ramirez
and Ramon.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell did likewise.</p>
<p>The two Mexicans had halted in front of a car
of midnight blue, long-snouted, with German nickel
trimmings. It stood on the edge of the parked
cars, indicating its owner had arrived early at the
bull fight. Late comers had been forced to go
farther along the road or to burrow deeper into the
field. Here, with one foot on the running board
and a hand extended to grasp the handle of the left
front door, Ramirez paused and, facing about, appeared
to be scolding his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly giving that old fellow, Ramon,
fits about something,&rdquo; whispered Bob. &ldquo;Wish I
could hear what he&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That a disagreement of some sort had arisen
between the two Mexicans was plain. Old Ramon
stood with hanging head, just out of reach of Ramirez,
while the latter berated him in a voice too
low for the words to carry to the eager ears of the
two watchers.</p>
<p>Bob strained his ears to hear, but that Captain
Cornell&rsquo;s thoughts were otherwise engaged was
evidenced when he suddenly emitted a sharp exclamation
under his breath, and then squeezed
Bob&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that car look familiar to you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Bob was puzzled. There
was something vaguely familiar about the appearance
of the big car beside which Ramirez stood, yet
he could not identify what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks familiar to me,&rdquo; said the flyer in
an excited undertone. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the car your friend
Don Ferdinand was riding in last night when he
bumped us, or I miss my guess. Look again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly,&rdquo; breathed Bob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how? How does this rascal Ramirez happen
to be driving it today? Didn&rsquo;t Don Ferdinand
say he was visiting friends and either tell us outright
or else leave us to infer that the car belonged
to those friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, how does Ramirez happen to be here
in it? Say, young feller, this is certainly worth investigation.
The plot thickens. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; The
flyer suddenly ceased talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what?&rdquo; asked Bob, who did not take
his eyes from the two Mexicans, and was interested
to note that Ramirez had advanced
threateningly toward Ramon who, in turn, had
backed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wonder if your friend, Don Ferdinand,
really is playing a deep game, and is in cahoots with
this Ramirez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a bit too thick,
Captain, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the Captain, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re probably
right. But what then? How account for that
car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe Don Ferdinand is in
trouble, captured, killed.&rdquo; Bob&rsquo;s voice grew
troubled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a reckless old firebrand.
And this fellow Ramirez looks like a bad hombre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a bad hombre,&rdquo; said the army flyer.
&ldquo;There.&rdquo; His hand gripped Bob&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look at
that. By George, I can&rsquo;t let that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without finishing his sentence, he whipped
out his service automatic and would have darted
into the open, but for the fact that Bob by main
strength restrained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, you hot head,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s putting
up his gun already. Ramon is giving in. You
sure would have spilled the beans.&rdquo; And he wiped
his face, on which the perspiration had suddenly
broke forth.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell looked a trifle shame-faced, yet
defiant, as he slid his weapon back into its scabbard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>The little drama which had so roused him was
over. Although unable to hear what was said between
the two Mexicans, the watchers guessed at
the meaning of the tableau which had just played
itself out. Ramon apparently had been reluctant to
accompany Ramirez further. The latter had
argued. Then he had whipped out a revolver. It
was this which had caused Captain Cornell to start
to take a hand. But Ramirez had needed only to
display his weapon. Ramon had yielded. Already
he was in the front seat, and Ramirez was climbing
to his seat behind the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to steal a car,&rdquo; said the flyer grimly, as
Ramirez started his motor. &ldquo;But I reckon we&rsquo;ll
have to do it. Of course, we can find the owner
later and square it with him. But Ramirez mustn&rsquo;t
escape, with the fate of your friend, Don Ferdinand,
undecided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded, his lips grimly compressed.</p>
<p>With a roar, the big blue car pulled out into the
rutted road, and started away in the opposite direction
from them&mdash;the direction toward town. So
worn was the road that Ramirez apparently was
keeping the car in low gear and not making much
speed. It was that fact which decided Bob. There
would be a possibility of keeping the fugitive in
sight.</p>
<p>He vaulted into the flivver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a key here that I think will switch on
the juice,&rdquo; he said, bending toward the dash board
of the ancient vehicle. &ldquo;You get around front, Captain,
and crank her. No self-starter on this model.
Must be the vintage of &rsquo;76. Hurray,&rdquo; he shouted
the next moment, caution forgotten, &ldquo;the switch is
on. Now give her a twirl, and look out for the
kick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell leaped to the front, seized the
crank and began to spin it. One turn, two, without
result. He cast a glance of dismay toward the
disappearing car bearing Ramirez and Ramon
away. Then he gave the crank another desperate
turn. This time the response was instant. There
was a sputter. Bob fed more gas. Then the
engine broke into a roar, and the old car shook
and rattled as if with ague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard,&rdquo; sang out Bob, who was now in the
grip of the spirit of adventure, and had cast scruples
to the wind. They needed a car, and Captain Cornell
was an American Army officer. They could
commandeer this flivver, if they wanted to! While
Bob was thus consoling himself, he was at the same
time steering the car out into the road.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell leaped into place beside him, just
as the big blue car rounded the distant curve of
the amphitheatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her the gas,&rdquo; shouted the flyer. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A HOUSE OF MYSTERY.</span></h2>
<p>They went.</p>
<p>As Bob raced down the rutted roadway, there
were only two thoughts in his head. Would they
be able to keep Ramirez in sight? And would their
commandeered car hold together? It creaked,
groaned, squeaked, grated, whined and wheezed,
but&mdash;it covered the ground. And, gaining confidence
in his vehicle, Bob opened the throttle to
its fullest extent. The ancient car seemed to leap
from ridge to ridge of the rutted road like a mountain
goat jumping from crag to crag. And like
the goat it made most amazing speed.</p>
<p>So much so, in fact, that when again Bob caught
sight of the midnight blue car ahead, he had gained
on it. His first question was answered. At this
rate of speed he most certainly would be able to
keep Ramirez in sight. In fact, he cut down his
speed in order not to close upon Ramirez to the
point where he might arouse the latter&rsquo;s suspicion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Thus the two cars, parted by the length of a city
block, burrowed by means of the bumpy dirt streets
deep into Nueva Laredo. The sun shone hot and
dust, whirled up by a brisk wind and further
stirred by their passage, settled upon them in choking
clouds. Here and there some ancient crone
slumbered in the open doorway of a hut, seeking
the comparative coolness created by the draught of
heated air through the doorway. But otherwise
the streets were deserted. Everybody who could
walk, crawl or ride had gone to the bull fight.</p>
<p>This way and that bounced Captain Cornell on
the frayed seat beside Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns, boy, take it a little easier, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he pleaded in gasps.</p>
<p>Bob clutched the wheel more tightly as a hole in
the road almost twisted it from his grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up and we&rsquo;ll lose &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The flyer groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expect that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he managed to say between
gasps. &ldquo;Ouch. Have a heart. How are
they getting away with this pace? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d
like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balloon tires on that baby,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and
snubbers. They&rsquo;re riding in a Pullman and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re in a freight car,&rdquo; groaned the flyer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t find fault with the gift horse,&rdquo; laughed
Bob, narrowly avoiding a particularly atrocious
hole with the front wheels of his chariot of joy only
to flop into it with the rear wheels.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell almost bounced out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a heart, Bob,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>But Bob held grimly on. They were on the outskirts
of the town now. For the last several blocks
they had been driving through a particularly low
quarter. The huts were of the poorest, being mere
jumbled collections of shingles and tin or of &rsquo;dobe,
with here and there a little patch of desert grass
enclosed in a rickety picket fence before the more
pretentious. As if satisfied with having done its
worst, with that last dreadful jouncing given them,
the roadway had become a little better. Bob was
still keeping his distance of a block behind the leading
car. He was wondering whether Ramirez and
Ramon were aware of his presence behind them
and, if so, whether their suspicions were aroused.
He was likewise beginning to ask himself whether
the chase would lead beyond the outskirts which
now loomed ahead, the thinning out of the houses
giving warning of approach to the open country
beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they lead us out into the country we&rsquo;ll be
out of luck,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how
much gas we have. Probably not much. That&rsquo;s
always the way when you need it. We&rsquo;d look fine,
wouldn&rsquo;t we, if we got ten or twenty miles down
into Mexico and the old bus died on us? Besides,
if we get out of town, they certainly will know
we&rsquo;re following &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo; Captain Cornell grunted. He was
thinking along similar lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, they&rsquo;re not suspicious of us yet, however,&rdquo;
Bob said, as another thought came to him.
&ldquo;Notice we haven&rsquo;t turned any corners for blocks?
Sticking to a straight road that way, it doesn&rsquo;t
look so much as if we were following them. Might
just be going the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car ahead slowed down before a two-story
frame house on the right hand side, and halted
alongside the wooden fence enclosing a small weed-grown
plot of ground in front. The house stood
in the next block. A street intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn right up this street,&rdquo; commanded Captain
Cornell quickly, and big Bob complied without asking
why.</p>
<p>At the same time he slowed down, but the flyer
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep going until the next cross street, then turn
left and we&rsquo;ll stop. That way, if they&rsquo;re watching
us, we&rsquo;ll get out of sight. Then we can leave the
car and sneak back to have a look from cover at
that house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Bob turned the next corner, finding himself in
a street as deserted as any they had passed through,
and with only a few houses in the block. All were
mere huts. Not a person, man, woman or child,
was in sight. The only signs of life were a few
chickens pecking dispiritedly at the ground under
a drooping pepper tree in the shade of which Bob
brought the car to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; he ejaculated, whipping out a handkerchief
and wiping his streaming face. &ldquo;That
was what you might call a real joy ride.&rdquo; He
climbed out and looked curiously at the springs of
the old car. They were rust-covered but sound.
Bob shook his head, marvelling. &ldquo;How those
springs stood it, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s hurry,&rdquo; said the flyer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
hike up to the next corner and then turn back
toward the street we left them on. That&rsquo;ll put us
beyond them and, unless they&rsquo;re watching for us,
we ought to be able to spy on that house without
much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob fell into step beside his companion and they
moved along briskly despite the oven-like heat
which brought out a profuse perspiration before
they had taken a half dozen paces.</p>
<p>Turning the corner to the left, they saw open
ahead of them a somewhat more pretentious street.
At least, it possessed a plank sidewalk upon that
side along which they proceeded, and the houses,
which were more numerous, seemed better built
and the enclosures before them were better kept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Captain Cornell&rsquo;s glance roving above the low
line of the single-story &rsquo;dobe houses was quick to
observe the rear of a two-story house on the intersecting
street ahead, and he called Bob&rsquo;s attention
with the remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the house. Maybe, we can find a vacant
lot ahead which will permit us to approach it
from the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bob paid little attention for at that moment
he, too was noting something of interest&mdash;nothing
less, in fact, than a lofty three-strand aerial of considerable
extent in the rear of a small &rsquo;dobe house
which they were approaching. As they drew
abreast of the swinging gate in the picket fence
which, for a wonder, was not a-dangle from only
one hinge, but was neat and trim as were all the
immediate surroundings of the place, a boy in his
&rsquo;teens stepped to the door and glanced at them inquiringly.</p>
<p>Acting on impulse, Bob halted at the gate and,
smiling at the lad, whose dark, olive-tinted face
was bright and intelligent in expression, he pointed
toward the aerial and asked in Spanish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radio? You have a receiving set?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, senor,&rdquo; the boy replied, moving forward
a step or two, &ldquo;but more than that, I send, too. I
have a two-way station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell had halted a step of two beyond
Bob. No man on the Border Patrol could go long
without acquiring a knowledge of Spanish, and as
a matter of fact he had fluent command of the
language. He understood, therefore, the nature of
the remarks exchanged by Bob and the young
Mexican lad, but he wasn&rsquo;t interested. His
thoughts were taken up with the problem of how to
approach the rear of that house of mystery without
detection. So now he turned to Bob with a
trace of impatience and said in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ve got work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob glanced aside so that the Mexican boy would
not observe and winked by way of reply. Captain
Cornell was mystified, he didn&rsquo;t understand. But
he had a good deal of respect for his companion,
little though he knew him, so he decided to hold
his hand a moment until he could discover what
Bob had in mind. For that Bob was up to something,
he felt assured. He moved closer.</p>
<p>Bob laughed, leaning on the gate as if he had
nothing in the world to do but exchange pleasant
conversation with the Mexican boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radio certainly is fascinating,&rdquo; he replied in
Spanish. &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it would
keep you from the bull fight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are an American, senor, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
asked the boy, a trace of scorn on his features. &ldquo;The
senor speaks my language well. But I can tell.
Well, that accounts for your mistake. Not all
Mexicans are animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here, here,&rdquo; cut in Bob, apologetically, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean any harm. Why, I&rsquo;ve just come from
the bull fight myself, and I thought it mighty exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s expression became somewhat mollified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Bob hurried on, anxious to overcome
the bad impression he obviously had created, and
still a bit puzzled as to just why the boy had taken
offense; &ldquo;you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I, myself, am a radio
enthusiast, and I know just how wrapped up in it
a fellow can become.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the boy moved closer. &ldquo;The senor Americano
will forgive my hasty temper. You see, he
added, breaking into more hurried speech, &ldquo;my
mother is a widow who lets me do as I will in
working with radio. But all her friends, they say&rdquo;&mdash;and
he shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;they say she is foolish,
touched in the head, to let me do so. They say,
senor, that the good God did not want us to hear
through the air for long distances or he would have
equipped our ears. They say what I do is sacrilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed with a touch of bitterness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Bob was taken aback. He saw now why his remark
about the bull fight had given offence. The
boy was embittered against people of his own race.
Poor kid, thought Bob, what a tough time he must
have! Fortunately his mother supported him.
Though how a Mexican widow, living in this poor
quarter of the town, should possess enough money
to enable her son to indulge his hobby was a facer.</p>
<p>While he still struggled mentally for a reply,
Captain Cornell cut in with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bob. They&rsquo;ll get away, maybe.
Thought you had something up your sleeve! But
just chinning this kid isn&rsquo;t getting us anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob saw he would have to inform his companion
of what was in his mind, so he replied rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Captain. What I wanted was
to get the boy&rsquo;s interest and then ask him about
that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Captain Cornell saw the light, and his
impatience in a measure abated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, addressing the boy again, &ldquo;my
friend here is anxious to be gone, so I suppose I&rsquo;ll
have to stop. I&rsquo;d like to talk some more to you
about radio, though. Maybe, some time, you&rsquo;ll let
me have a look at your set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, senor,&rdquo; said the boy, all eagerness.
&ldquo;Right now, if the senor wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be moving. By
the way, though,&rdquo; he added, letting his glance rove
toward the rear of the two-story house on the next
street, the upper windows of which could be seen
above the low &rsquo;dobe adjoining the boy&rsquo;s home; &ldquo;by
the way, though, do you know who happens to live
in that house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stepped closer, in order to face about
and see what place Bob was indicating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that house. Why, senor, it is somewhat of
a mystery in this neighborhood. A Japanese
gentleman lives there, and many Japanese come
and go continually. But none of us has ever
spoken to those people. The windows, as you see,
are always shuttered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned around to face Bob and drew closer.
Instinctively, his voice dropped as he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every now and then there are many cars which
come up there at night and then depart&mdash;nobody
knows where. They are closed cars. And last
night, senor, there was a scream, a terrible scream.
I was sitting up very late at my radio, and had just
gone to the door to get a breath of air. Then I
heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Captain,&rdquo; said Bob, excitedly, turning to
his companion, &ldquo;hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">CAPTAIN CORNELL INVESTIGATES.</span></h2>
<p>Indeed, Captain Cornell had heard, and he immediately
moved into place at the gate beside Bob
and began asking excited questions in Spanish. Was
it a man or a woman who screamed? A man? Oh,
and the Captain&rsquo;s face betrayed disappointment.
Mere mention of the fact that a scream had shattered
the midnight quiet in this remote quarter had
aroused his sense of the romantic to a point where,
with nothing else to go on, he had imagined the beginnings
of a pretty mystery centering about a
damsel in distress.</p>
<p>What a come-down to find not a woman but a man
had screamed! Still he was an incorrigible romanticist.
His imagination leaped to other possibilities.
He shot other questions at the boy. There had been
a fight, not so? Shots had been fired? The Mexican
police had appeared on the scene?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>But to all these questions the boy shook his head
by way of reply. No, nothing. Only that first
blood-curdling scream, such a scream as made the
hair stand on end. He, Juan Salazar, was his
mother&rsquo;s sole defender. He had therefore not
deemed it advisable to leave the house defenceless
and go to investigate. And at that statement, both
Bob and Captain Cornell found it difficult to repress
their smiles. But they managed to do so and thus
avoided giving the boy deadly offense. On the contrary,
continued the boy, he had withdrawn indoors,
barred the door and put out his light in order not to
call attention to his house, in case&mdash;in case&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell came to the youth&rsquo;s rescue with
a grave nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, the senor must believe me,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;It was a terrible scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob and the flyer looked at each other. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
have been Don Ferdinand,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
disappear until this morning. At least, it was only
a few hours ago that we got his telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind reader,&rdquo; accused the flyer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just
what I was thinking of. But&mdash;then who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Bob. And then a daring
light came into his eyes. &ldquo;What do you say to our
making an investigation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. How would you go
about it? Just mosey up to the door and say to whoever
comes: &lsquo;Who made that noise last night?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The flyer gave a short laugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get far,
wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might go up to the front door and ask
to see Don Ferdinand. Just say we noticed his car
in the street and dropped in to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; The flyer grunted disgustedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to do better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, think of something yourself,&rdquo; said
Bob. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that last idea, anyhow?
We&rsquo;ve got&mdash;no, by George, I haven&rsquo;t any
weapon. But you&rsquo;ve got your service automatic. I
know, because you pulled it out back there outside
the bull ring. We&rsquo;d certainly take &rsquo;em by surprise,
and something might come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell shook his head pityingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been out in this sun too long, old man,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While this semi-humorous conversation had been
going on, the Mexican boy had withdrawn a short
distance and stood with his hands thrust into his
pockets and his eyes bent toward the ground in
thoughtful contemplation. Now he looked up and
glancing toward Bob said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Americano might like to know that there is
something strange about that house. I found it out
by accident one day. On that street beyond&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
toward the lane on which the two Americans
had abandoned their commandeered car&mdash;&ldquo;there
is a deserted house. It is only a poor sort of
place of &rsquo;dobe. But one day I saw a man come out
of it, carefully, looking around as if to make sure he
was not observed. So, then, I happened to pass that
house later and, seeing that it was a time when
nobody was in sight, I tried the door. It was open,
and I went in. There, senor, I found a trap door
which I opened. Beneath it were steps. I even went
down them and found at the foot a tunnel. Senor,
it was really none of my business, so I did not investigate
farther. But that tunnel leads to the house
of the Japanese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? How do you know?&rdquo; barked Captain
Cornell.</p>
<p>Conscious that he held their interest, the boy regarded
the flyer with a superior air. Then he unbent.
What good was it to possess a secret, if you
couldn&rsquo;t share it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, senor, that is not difficult,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
man who came out of the door of the little house was
a man I had seen entering the house of the Japanese.
He is of my race, and he has a crooked nose and a
limp of the right leg. I could not be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramirez,&rdquo; ejaculated Bob, and Captain Cornell
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know this man?&rdquo; asked the boy quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob hastily, &ldquo;we know of him. He
is a rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>As for Captain Cornell, he appeared to be lost in
thought. After a long moment he turned to Bob.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re on the track of something, that&rsquo;s sure.
Let&rsquo;s walk up to the corner and see if the car we
followed is still there. Then we can talk it over.
Guess, we&rsquo;ve learned all we can from this kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded, and turning to the Mexican lad he
again dropped a warm word about radio, promising
to return some time and examine the boy&rsquo;s apparatus.
The lad beamed, his earlier offended state forgotten.
Then Bob and the flyer walked briskly toward the
distant street intersection, a long block away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this?&rdquo; Bob asked. &ldquo;This
house owned by a Japanese&mdash;with lots of other
Japanese there&mdash;people driving away at night&mdash;the
secret passage&mdash;that scream last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed the flyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning
to get the glimmerings of a vague suspicion.
Not all we have learned, however, fits in with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; pressed Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not worth mentioning yet,&rdquo; said the flyer. &ldquo;But
here&rsquo;s the corner. Now for a look&mdash;see.&rdquo; And halting
at the edge of a building on the corner, he peered
around it and along the length of the thoroughfare
down which they had jounced and jolted not long
before.</p>
<p>Bob likewise stole a glance from shelter, chuckling
as he did so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must look like a couple of conspirators in a
melodrama,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pussyfooting up to the corner
and then poking our heads out this way. Good thing
everybody&rsquo;s gone to the bull fight or we&rsquo;d rouse
somebody&rsquo;s suspicions and, maybe, have the place
down about our ears. But there isn&rsquo;t a soul to see
us. The place is like a village of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little enough, however, was there to see. The
long street was deserted as far as the eye could rove.
It lay baking under the late afternoon sun, and the
only object of interest anywhere apparent was what
they had looked to find&mdash;the handsome car midway
down the block.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calle Lebertad,&rdquo; read a battered and defaced
street sign on a post on the opposite side of the street.
Doubtless, a similar sign appeared on the post ahead
of them on their corner, but, as it faced outward,
they could not note it. Bob called the flyer&rsquo;s attention
to the sign, remarking that at least they now
knew what street the mysterious house stood on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lotta good that does us,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell,
slangily, in disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get closer to that
house, Bob. I have a hunch we might overhear
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I?&rdquo; Bob promptly agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
Don Ferdinand is in there, and I&rsquo;d like to get him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of that right now,&rdquo; said the
flyer. He was silent, thinking. Finally he gave a
decisive little nod. &ldquo;By George, it&rsquo;s better than
doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is? Shall we have a try at storming the
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. But I think I&rsquo;ll take a stroll
down the street. Maybe I&rsquo;ll hear something. The
house is isolated. It&rsquo;s probably open on account of
this heat. If people are talking inside, I may catch
a hint of what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a stroll?&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Why not
&lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go alone. Best not to put our eggs in
one basket. Besides if by any chance, somebody
jumps me, I&rsquo;ve got a gun and can defend myself.
You haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. Guess I can swing a mean fist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flyer grinned. &ldquo;Nothing doing. I&rsquo;ve got
charge of this expedition, and orders are that you
stay here and watch me. Besides, if I get into
trouble, you&rsquo;ll be free to bring aid, while if you were
along and we both were done in&mdash;just supposing the
worst that might happen&mdash;where would your friends
look for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob grumbled, only half-convinced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stroll around the block and join you here
again,&rdquo; said the flyer. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s going to happen.
Really, there&rsquo;s not much sense in my going, only I
do feel that there&rsquo;s a chance of learning something.
In case anything does happen to me, hop back to our
stolen flivver and light out for Laredo and when you
get near the Bridge abandon the car so that you
won&rsquo;t be stopped in case the owner has sent out a
police warning. We&rsquo;ll square accounts for that car
later. Cross the Bridge and go to the nearest telephone
and call the Border Patrol. Ask for Captain
Murray. Remember that name, Murray. Tell him
what&rsquo;s what, and he&rsquo;ll attend to the rest. And don&rsquo;t
by any chance make the mistake of trying to come to
my rescue single-handed, because without a gun
you&rsquo;d be a goner. And you&rsquo;d be throwing away my
chance, too. I don&rsquo;t think anything&rsquo;s going to happen,
but if it does, I want to be sure you&rsquo;ll stick to
that plan. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Bob, ungraciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
as you say. Only you must see that it doesn&rsquo;t give
me a chance for action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. If you should have to
call for Murray, you&rsquo;ll have to be his guide. And
that would bring you action a-plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he be out of luck, invading a foreign
country?&rdquo; asked Bob, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to him. Anyway, what are we
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just acting on our own,&rdquo; said Bob.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. Well, so long. See you in a couple
of minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; answered Bob. &ldquo;And the best of
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Captain Cornell strolled nonchalantly
around the corner, and set off at the dawdling pace
of the loafer, toward the house of mystery and the
car of midnight blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">A NOVEL S. O. S.</span></h2>
<p>It was a silent sun-drenched street. Down at
the bull ring they were just then watching Estramadura
in the act of despatching his second bull,
with ahead of them the prospect of Juan Salento
playing a return engagement, making the fourth
and final fight of the afternoon. No well-regulated
bull fight at Nueva Laredo would pretend to be
worthy of consideration without four encounters.
Estramadura had been followed by his Mexican
rival, who had successfully defended his reputation
and had performed even more thrillingly than his
fellow matador from Spain. Practically all Nueva
Laredo was down there making holiday, and so not
a soul appeared in sight on the sun-filled Calle
Libertad except Captain Cornell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Reconnoitering from the corner, Bob watched
the departing back of his companion, enviously at
first. Just his luck, he thought somewhat bitterly,
to be left out of the fun. He recalled his words
earlier uttered to Frank and Jack to the effect that
no adventures ever were going to happen to him
again. Well, wasn&rsquo;t this proving the truth of his
prophecy, he argued? Here he was, led up to a
possible adventure, and then left standing safely,
out of all possibility of becoming involved in it himself.</p>
<p>Then he grinned to himself as he noticed Captain
Cornell swinging farther along the silent, deserted
street. Probably, after all, nothing was going
to happen to him, either. It certainly looked as
if that house of mystery, with the midnight blue
car at the door, was incapable of producing adventure.
Captain Cornell would have his walk for
nothing. He&rsquo;d just swing around the block and
come back to where Bob was standing, and have
his pains for nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Bob grinned as he shifted weight on the other
foot, and sought a new resting place for his
shoulder against the &rsquo;dobe wall of the little house
against which he was leaning. It was a sour grin.
After coming this far, after running off with somebody
else&rsquo;s car, Bob wanted something to happen.
Nevertheless, nothing was going to happen.
Of that now he became convinced. It took Captain
Cornell an interminably long time to reach the
house of mystery. But now at last he was abreast
of it. Bob peering forth contracted his brows in
a frown of disappointment. He didn&rsquo;t want any
harm to come to his companion, of course. Just
the same, he did have the feeling of having been
cheated by fate. There was Captain Cornell
sauntering leisurely by the house into which Ramirez
had disappeared, glancing casually at the car
of midnight blue and pausing a moment to examine
it.</p>
<p>Bob paid due tribute to that bit of acting. &ldquo;Just
what a fellow strolling by might be expected to
do,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Naturally, when he sees a
handsome car like that, all by itself, out here in
the &lsquo;Sticks,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll give it a glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then two men came out of the house. The
figure of one was unfamiliar. The other, however,
Bob made sure, despite the distance intervening,
was Ramirez. Captain Cornell straightened up at
the sound of footsteps behind him.</p>
<p>Bob held his breath. No, they were merely going
to climb into the car, it appeared. And the
doughty flyer was saying something to them.
Doubtless, a word of apology for examining the
car. All three stood in a little group. Ramirez
and Captain Cornell seemed to be engaged in conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Suddenly, so swiftly that for the moment Bob
was left stunned and breathless, the other of the
precious pair who was slightly in the rear of the
American flyer hit him on the head with some small
object. Captain Cornell did not even scream. Instead,
he fell forward stricken into the waiting
arms of Ramirez, and the latter and his companion
started dragging him up the steps.</p>
<p>At that Bob&rsquo;s wits returned in a measure and,
darting away from the corner as if hurled from a
bow, he shot forward at arrow-like speed. He
uttered no sound, his feet made no noise on the
dirt sidewalk that could be heard far down the
block. And Ramirez and his companion did not
look toward him.</p>
<p>But before he had gone a hundred feet, the two
men dragging the insensible form of the American
flyer disappeared within the house.</p>
<p>Bob groaned and pulled up short. To dash on
and beat at the doors of that sinister house, unarmed
and alone, would be nothing less than madness.
It was the thing which he felt like doing,
but good sense warned against it.</p>
<p>No, he must think of some other way of rescuing
his companion. And now, as standing there in
the street, the knowledge of what depended upon
him alone came to him, he was filled with anxiety
lest already he might have attracted unwelcome attention
to his presence. He looked around quickly
to see if he was observed, but the street was as
blank, as deserted, as before Captain Cornell had
started strolling down its length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Yet tragedy had struck in those few brief
minutes! Bob shivered, not with physical fear, but
in the uncanny feeling that everywhere there were
eyes watching his every move. He couldn&rsquo;t see
anybody, yet the feeling persisted. Putting it
down to taut nerves, and deciding that the best
thing for him to do was to get back around the
corner and out of sight Bob turned and ran back to
his former vantage point. There he paused for another
look down the Calle Libertad. What irony,
he thought! Liberty Street!</p>
<p>Seeing no signs of life behind him, he started to
retrace his steps toward the commandeered flivver,
over the route which he and Captain Cornell had
so recently covered. There was only one thing to
do, and that was to act as Captain Cornell had directed.
Get into that flivver, race madly for the
Bridge, abandon the car out of sight of the Bridge
police, and then get a taxi to the American side
and there telephone Captain Murray at the flying
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know what to do,&rdquo; Captain Cornell had
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, hurry, hurry,&rdquo; was beating in Bob&rsquo;s
brain. He began to run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, Senor,&rdquo; a voice called. Bob turned his
head. It was the Mexican lad with whom he had
been talking only a short time before. &ldquo;Senor,&rdquo;
said the boy, coming to the fence as Bob slowed
his pace, &ldquo;are you not going to inspect my radio?&rdquo;
There was entreaty in his voice. But it was not
the lad&rsquo;s pleading which caused Bob to pale as if
smitten. Great Scott, why hadn&rsquo;t he thought of
this before? Why, he could radio the American
flying field from this station, and while rescuers
were on their way, could keep the house into which
his friend had been dragged, under surveillance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he, swinging up to the fence,
and leaning across with his hands gripping the
pickets, &ldquo;my friend is in trouble. Will you help
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, what do you mean? How can I help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me use your radio to call for assistance for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s eyes bored into the lad. How far dared
he trust him?</p>
<p>A shrewd look crossed the Mexican youth&rsquo;s features.
He looked up at Bob, towering above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it something about the house of the Japanese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Bob leaped the fence. If the lad gave him permission
to use the radio, well and good. If he
didn&rsquo;t, well&mdash;Bob&rsquo;s lips set into a grim line. Now
that he saw this way out of his dilemma, he intended
to use it whether the youngster objected or
not. But, instead of objecting or of showing fear,
the boy, on the contrary, was all eagerness to help.</p>
<p>To him this was the call to adventure. He
sensed the presence of a mystery, and he was all
a-quiver to have a hand in it. Seizing Bob by a
sleeve, he turned and sped toward the open door of
the little house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Senor,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If my radio
can be of service, use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In two steps they were across the threshold and
in a spotlessly neat room sparsely furnished, with
a shining array of instruments along one side wall,
upon which Bob&rsquo;s eye instantly fell. But before
making for the radio table, Bob turned to the boy
and asked: &ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She visits her sister. I am alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring everything else in the room Bob crossed
the intervening space in two great strides and
flinging himself into the waiting chair began hastily
running his eye over the instrument board in front
of him. His host was at his shoulder, explaining
in quick prideful phrases. Impatiently Bob stopped
his flow of words with upraised hand. He was
trying to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What street is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, but&mdash;&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s thoughts did not follow
so readily. &ldquo;Oh, the Street of Our Lady of
Guadalupe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. And that street back there&rdquo;&mdash;pointing&mdash;&ldquo;the
one where you said was this secret passage
into the Japanese house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Avenue of the Presidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; And he
swung the transmitter toward him. &ldquo;Say, you
know the calls of the stations around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, there are none except my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy swelled out his chest like a pouter
pigeon, and Bob had hard work cloaking a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean across the Border. What&rsquo;s the call of the
American flying field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, it doesn&rsquo;t broadcast. I do not know.
But is it the flyers you would call? Are you an
aviator? Is your companion an aviator? What
has happened? You have not told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses,&rdquo; said Bob, at this flood of
questions, lapsing into English. &ldquo;Thou shalt be
told,&rdquo; he added hastily in the youth&rsquo;s own speech.
&ldquo;All in good time. Meantime, there is a man to be
aided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you call a Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob, grimly. &ldquo;A couple of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that a plan of procedure which his mind
had been busy upon all the time that he had been
answering the boy&rsquo;s questions took shape and, picking
up a hammer and a metal bar, he began striking
them together in front of the broadcaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Clang, clang,&rdquo; rang the strokes in the little
room, until it sounded like a smithy. The boy
stood with open mouth. It was hot, and the perspiration
poured down Bob&rsquo;s face in runlets. But
still he hammered on. Once he paused to pick up
the headpiece from the table and clap the phones to
his ears. Then he resumed operations. For a moment
or two he would bang away, then wait, listening;
then he would start banging again.</p>
<p>At last the boy could not restrain himself any
more. He plucked Bob by a sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morse,&rdquo; flung out Bob. &ldquo;Keep quiet a minute.
Think I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened, and a triumphant grin overspread
his features. Then, rapidly, with hammer and
metal bar, he again resumed telegraphing. Finally,
laying his makeshift key aside, he spoke rapidly
into the transmitter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;speed up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">BOB HAS AN IDEA.</span></h2>
<p>From that ordeal Bob sat back with a smile of
triumph upon his face. Hot it was, beastly hot, and
the very tautness of his nerves during the time
when he had sought unavailingly to gain the attention
of the American aviation field had brought out
the perspiration stinging on his body. But he had
succeeded, he had gained the ear of a wireless
operator and help had been promised him in as short
a time as it would take to journey in high-powered
motor cars to his present whereabouts. Therefore,
he could afford to forget the wretched discomfort of
his body, and did so.</p>
<p>Why he had used the Morse code he could not
have told. Something had impelled him to do so,
some warning or inner prompting not to call in English
lest, perchance, there should be someone tuning
in on the Mexican side of the Border who would
hear and understand. A certain risk he must run
in using Morse, yet a considerably lessened risk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>And at any rate, he had been understood. His
message of pleading had been received at the flying
field. Of that he was certain. And now help would
come, help for the rescuing of his comrade from the
sinister house into which he had been dragged.</p>
<p>But how long before the American aviators, rushing
to the rescue, would arrive? They had said no
time would be wasted in attempts to obtain the aid
of the police of Nueva Laredo, but that they would
come post haste. Yet still a measure of time must
intervene. The flying field was some miles distant
from Laredo. There might be delays at the Bridge.
Bob&rsquo;s smile of triumph slowly faded to give way to
a look of worry.</p>
<p>Young Juan Salazar watched him with puzzled
frown all this while. He was too polite, seeing Bob&rsquo;s
pre-occupation, to interrupt with questions. But
they crowded to his lips. There were so many things
that he wanted to know. This likable young American
was in trouble, his companion in worse case. And
Juan had a healthy boy&rsquo;s curiosity to learn all about
it. Yet still Bob sat silent, his eyes bent in a growing
frown upon the floor, and still Juan held his
peace while the flies buzzed in the unscreened room
for all its cleanliness. Until at length the younger
lad no longer could restrain himself and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, can you not trust me? What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>At that Bob woke with a start from his moodiness
and looked at Juan a long minute while the thoughts
upon which he had been pondering dropped into the
background. Could the boy be trusted? There was
a ring of sincerity in his tone, an honest scorn in his
references earlier to the house which harbored
Ramirez. Yes, he could be trusted. So then Bob
got up from his chair and strode to the door, and
back again, and once more sat down in an endeavor
to still the nervousness preying upon him.</p>
<p>If there were only something he could do, he
thought, to while away the dragging minutes before
help could arrive. And at that he leaped from his
chair with a sharp exclamation. There was something
he could do; of a certainty, there was. And
what was more, it was something which ought to
be done. Fool that he was not to have thought of
it earlier?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan,&rdquo; he exclaimed sharply, &ldquo;we are in trouble
of the worst sort. You have been a good lad and
have helped me much with permission to use your
radio. Are you willing now to help more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; said Juan, drawing himself up proudly.
&ldquo;You are in trouble. And if I can be of help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can, indeed,&rdquo; Bob interrupted. &ldquo;Listen.
This is a mess. It&rsquo;s too long to explain now. We
would waste valuable moments in doing so. Juan,
there are evil men in that house. They have captured
my companion and dragged him within. Me
they did not see. I do not believe they know I am
in the vicinity. My friend is an American Army
aviator. I have called for others who will be here
shortly from the Laredo flying field. I gave them
your address, and directed them to approach by the
Avenue of the Presidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attend now,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Until they
come we must keep watch to see whether anyone
leaves that house. There are two entrances: the
front of the house and this secret tunnel through
the deserted house on the Avenue of the Presidents
of which you have told me. I shall return to the
corner of Calle Libertad and keep watch upon the
front of the house, and do you post yourself so as
to command a view of the secret exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let us go. We have wasted too much
time already. They may already have gone.
Though, if their automobile is still before the house,
I shall feel fairly assured that they are still within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And concluding, Bob took young Juan by an arm
and firing a piercing gaze upon the other&rsquo;s flushed
face, demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, come, let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Juan frowned deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rescuers. If they come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;They will come by the Avenue of the Presidents.
You must hail them and bring them here and summon
me. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go. And I&rsquo;ll take up my position.&rdquo; And
hurrying Juan with him, Bob flung out of the house.
The lad sprang one way and Bob another, and both
ran along the deserted street without anyone to observe
them or to marvel at this strange haste on a
day so hot that even the scattered pepper and
madrona trees, the dust of the roadway, and the
drowsing mean little houses seemed cooked into lifelessness.</p>
<p>Back at his corner Bob peered forth with beating
heart, eager to see if the car was still there, fearful
of finding it gone. Had the latter been the case, he
would have been at a loss, indeed, to know what next
to do. Poor lad, it had all come upon him so suddenly
that he was filled with self-reproaches and
revilings. But the car still stood at the curb, and
there was no more sign of life along the Calle Libertad
than on that street at his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>So then he crouched there by the corner of the
mud-walled house and gave himself up thoroughly
and completely to bitter reflections. The role in
which he found himself was one altogether new.
Many a time had he been in tight places with his
comrades, Frank and Jack. In fact, wherever they
went and whatever they did, trouble seemed to follow
them as inevitably as tides beat on the shore.
But never that he could recall had he been placed in
a passive position. And big Bob, who was not given
overly much to deep thought, but was accustomed
when in difficulties to hew his way out by main
strength or at least to make the attempt so to do,
groaned aloud.</p>
<p>The next moment he looked around fearfully, to
see if he had been overheard. His nerves were
jumpy. This atmosphere of the dead was getting
on him. Especially, when he knew that all was not
as quiet and deserted as the appearance of the streets
would seem to give warrant. There was at least
one house in which lurked sinister men. And if in
one, why not in another?</p>
<p>But nothing not seen before met his gaze, and
once more he returned to his vigil, while once more
his thoughts played with the subject. Should he
have let Captain Cornell venture forth alone upon
his stroll past the house beyond? When the flyer
was struck down without chance to offer a blow in
self-defense, should he have gone forward as he had
started to do and make attempt at rescue? Had he
been coward to halt and turn back? But here good
sense came to the fore and assured him that he had
done the wisest thing. And good sense argued,
moreover, that he had done more&mdash;he had, in fact,
done the very wisest thing possible under the circumstances
in calling the aviation field by radio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>And so, somewhat heartened, he turned his
thoughts to speculation upon what mischief Ramirez
intended. What was going on in that shuttered
house of the Japanese? Where was Don Ferdinand
and had evil befallen him? What had betrayed Captain
Cornell to his undoing? Had he said something
which aroused the suspicion of Ramirez, causing
the latter to signal his men to fell the flyer? Had
Ramirez seen and recognized them at the bull fight,
and, recalling that, on beholding Captain Cornell
face to face, struck on the impulse? He could not
know, and shrugged. These were questions that
would have to await developments for answer.</p>
<p>And so he stood and watched the length of the
street, and wiped the sweat from his face from time
to time, while his thoughts raced on their futile
questionings. Every now and then he would look
at his watch, and each time he would marvel anew
at the slow and dragging passage of the minutes.
It was not yet time for Captain Murray to arrive.
Not by any possibility could he have covered the
miles so quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Yet Bob was fretting at the delay. What if
Ramirez emerged before Murray&rsquo;s arrival? And
started to depart? Bob could not halt him single
handed? And if he took with him Captain Cornell,
perhaps bound and gagged, what track of them
could Bob keep? The flivver, yes, the flivver. He
could and would follow in that, provided they did
not pass from sight before he could get to where it
was parked on the back street. But even then, the
damage would be great. If Ramirez should go any
considerable distance, if, for instance, he should
elect to go into the country&mdash;to some hiding place&mdash;how
track him without discovery?</p>
<p>All he could do was hope that help would arrive
before any possible departure of Ramirez. And
while he was thinking upon this, there came to him
suddenly the suspicion that Ramirez might suspect
he was under surveillance and might leave the automobile
before the house as a blind and quietly withdraw
with his captive by means of the secret exit.
True, young Juan kept watch there. But if that
happened, if Ramirez should seek thus to escape,
would Juan be able to bring him warning in time
for him to take the trail?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>He turned at the thought, glancing up the street
at his back. And his heart gave a bound, then
seemed to stop, then raced on. And he groaned once
more aloud. For down the street, pelting as hard
as he could come, raced Juan Salazar. There was
only one conclusion to be drawn and, as that took
shape in his thoughts, Bob deserted his post and began
running wildly to meet the Mexican lad. Nor
for a moment did he note that behind the boy and
close upon his heels came another figure, rounding
the distant corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">SETTING THE TRAP.</span></h2>
<p>But all in a moment Bob saw, and his heart
gave a great bound as if it would leave his breast.
And then he but ran the harder. Until presently
the running form behind young Juan closed up on
the latter and drew abreast of him, and then two
young fellows, breathing hard, paused and faced
each other while from Bob&rsquo;s lips burst the single
exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a ghost?&rdquo; panted the latter, for
in his comrade&rsquo;s eyes was such a gaze of utter astonishment
as to prompt the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob slowly. &ldquo;No-o.&rdquo; And the color
which had drained from his cheeks returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; And he passed a hand across his eyes,
as if to test whether what he saw was vision or
reality. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;how in the world did
you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a taxi,&rdquo; said Frank. And now Bob noted
a twinkle in his comrade&rsquo;s eyes, and he sensed that
the latter was enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>He looked aside, puzzled, and noted young Juan
standing by, all impatience, bouncing first on one
leg and then on another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, Juan,&rdquo; he said in Spanish, &ldquo;tell me.
How did you happen to meet this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Senor, he and two others came racing in
a taxicab along the Avenue of the Presidents. And
I, thinking them your aviators, stepped out in the
street and called to them to stop. Then they asked
where you were, and I explained, and brought this
one with me. And the others&mdash;they remain to keep
watch on the place of which you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob made a gesture which seemed to say that
he was more deeply bemused than before, and once
more turned to Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think a minute, old hot head,&rdquo; laughed Frank.
&ldquo;It was easy. You called the aviation field by radio
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then Bob interrupted, as the light dawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott,&rdquo; he cried, punching Frank so hard
that the latter reeled backward; &ldquo;what a boob! I
forgot entirely about that belt radio of yours. So
you heard me call.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not I?&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but Jack. He was wearing
it at the time. He remembers Morse better
than I because he&rsquo;s been using it lately. And when
he heard you rapping out your call for the aviation
field he became excited, and when he heard your
explanation and call for help, nothing could hold
him. He listened just long enough to get your directions.
Then he and his father and I almost
fought our way to the exit. For, you see, the bull
fighting was still going on and the crowd hated to
be disturbed by having us make our way out. We
got many an ugly look, and there were cries against
the hated Gringoes. I looked for a knife between
my ribs every minute. But we managed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then down at the gate there came a taxi
cruising along providentially. Jack talked to the
chauffeur, who said he could land us at the right
place. Lucky you gave such explicit directions.
And here we are. The rest you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded. He was silent a moment, thinking.
This unexpected appearance of help changed the
complexion of matters. He must speak to Jack and
Mr. Hampton and put them in full possession of
the facts. But the corner he had watched must not
be left unguarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan,&rdquo; he said, turning to the Mexican boy,
&ldquo;these are not the aviators, but some other friends.
We can do nothing as yet. I must consult with the
others. Will you take my place at yonder corner
and keep vigilant watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>And young Juan, who was all a-quiver with the
thrill of being in the midst of a mystery, sped willingly
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Bob took Frank&rsquo;s arm and headed
him about.</p>
<p>Around the corner, and some distance removed
from the deserted house which marked the exit of
the secret tunnel, stood a taxicab drawn up behind
the rattle-and-bang flivver which Bob and Captain
Cornell had commandeered at the bull ring. Beside
it on the sidewalk stood Mr. Hampton and
Jack, and at the wheel drowsed the chauffeur. A
quick glance showed Bob he was an American, one
of the hardened Laredo breed.</p>
<p>Mutual explanations were quickly made, and
then the three boys talked excitedly but in lowered
voices, while Mr. Hampton listened with a smile
of amusement. Hot heads they were, all for trying
to gain entrance to the house into which Captain
Cornell had been dragged, despite the fact that they
were unarmed.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hampton shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; persisted Bob. &ldquo;All we have to do
is to go up to the door and demand that our friend
be turned over to us. There are five of us, counting
the chauffeur, and Ramirez wouldn&rsquo;t dare to
start anything with such a mob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;In broad daylight? I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; scoffed
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the United States, Bob,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;No, the best we can do is to keep
watch to see that they don&rsquo;t escape, and for that
purpose I think we better divide our forces. Frank
and I&rsquo;ll run around to young Juan&rsquo;s corner in the
taxi, while you and Jack stay here with the flivver.
We&rsquo;ll be ready in either case to take the trail,
whether they leave by front or rear. Not that I
believe Ramirez will leave until after dark, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; grumbled Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got sense
enough to see that what you propose is really the
right course. Just the same, I&rsquo;d like a little action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton smiled, then his face drew into a
thoughtful frown. &ldquo;I wonder what is Ramirez&rsquo;s
game,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wonder how he became suspicious of
Captain Cornell,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Well, no use speculating.
You better get under way, if we are to
keep double watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>With a nod of agreement, Mr. Hampton turned
toward the taxicab, beckoning Frank to follow.
But they were not destined to put their plan into
execution, for at that moment, Jack halted his
father and pointed up the street. All turned to
gaze. A powerful motor car, with the top down
and spilling over with men, was approaching at
high speed. A comet&rsquo;s tail of dust whirled and
eddied behind it. And the driven motor gave off
a droning roar that was music to their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray,&rdquo; cried Bob, exuberantly, &ldquo;Captain
Murray and his gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped into the middle of the street, waving
his arms frantically, and the car slackened speed
and rolled to a stop behind the taxi. A half dozen
young men, looking fit for anything, leaped to the
ground and crowded around Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead us to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, fellows, give him air,&rdquo; said one, jovially,
yet with the unmistakable ring of authority in his
voice. Shoving aside one of the newcomers who
blocked his way, he confronted Bob with out-stretched
hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Murray, and I guess you&rsquo;re
Bob Temple, aren&rsquo;t you? Didn&rsquo;t get the chance to
meet you the other day when Cornell had you out
at the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob looked into keen blue eyes on a level with
his own, set in a sunburned face that won his instant
liking. Their hands gripped, fell apart.
Each felt an instinctive regard for the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;All we know is what you gave us through the
air,&rdquo; laughed Captain Murray. &ldquo;Shoot both barrels
as quickly as you can, so we know how the land lies.
Then we&rsquo;ll go into action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but, first, meet the rest of
my gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Introductions followed, while Bob explained
how his two friends and Mr. Hampton, overhearing
his S.O.S. call to the aviators, had themselves
responded. Briefly, he put Captain Murray in possession
of the major facts.</p>
<p>The latter nodded briskly at Bob&rsquo;s conclusion.
&ldquo;First thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you fellows who brought
two automatics, kick loose with the spares. Right&mdash;&rdquo;
As his brother aviators began arming Mr. Hampton
and the three boys. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see.
There are ten of us, not counting the chauffeur.
I&rsquo;ll take four and go &rsquo;round to the front of the
house. Lieutenant Bracewell, do you take charge
with the other half of our party at this end. Mr.
Hampton, will you and your son come with me.
Hartridge, Thorsen. Fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped to the wheel of the big car, and the
others piled in behind him. A momentary pressure
on the starter button, and the engine began to
purr. Then he leaned out to give final instructions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;re going to get Cornell out of that.
But I want you to remember that we&rsquo;re in a foreign
country. If this came out, there would be a
pretty mess. However, the outfit we are after undoubtedly
is comprised of crooks who won&rsquo;t air
their difficulties, so I think we are reasonably safe
from the danger of embroiling the government with
the Mexican authorities. However, if any trouble
develops, I&rsquo;ll take the blame. You all are acting
under my orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lieutenant Bracewell, I&rsquo;m going to pick
up this Mexican boy that Bob has stationed around
the corner and he&rsquo;ll point out the house. Then I&rsquo;m
going to go right up to the door and demand entrance.
If they turn Cornell over to us, well and
good. If they resist and I need help, I&rsquo;ll blow my
whistle. You will be able to hear easily. Meantime,
guard this secret exit. Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Lieutenant Bracewell, a slender taunt
youngster little older than Bob, nodded. Among
the aviators was an easy <i>camaraderie</i> that to Army
martinets would have seemed lamentable. Yet
co-operation was none the less effective.</p>
<p>Captain Murray released the clutch and the car
rolled ahead, gathered speed, whirled around the
corner, and disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Wasting no time, the young commander turned
at once toward Bob with a question regarding the
secret tunnel. Bob explained what Juan had told
him. The other nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the best thing for us to do is
to get into that house and keep watch right at that
trap door. Should the rascals try to escape that way,
it will be an easy matter to bag &rsquo;em one at a time
as they climb out, while if we wait outside for them
there is bound to be a fight. And we want to avoid
bloodshed, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded enthusiastic endorsement, and without
any more being said the whole party with the
exception of the American chauffeur of the taxicab
started toward the house. Frank dropped behind
for a word with the jehu, then rejoined the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to keep out of it,&rdquo; Frank said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
all right, but he has to do business in this town and
doesn&rsquo;t like the notoriety. I told him we&rsquo;d pay him
handsomely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they approached the deserted house, Lieutenant
Bracewell took the lead and tried the door.
It was locked. They looked around for something
with which to pry open the lock, but without success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, no time to waste,&rdquo; said the young leader.
And stepping up, he placed the muzzle of his automatic
against the key hole and pressed the trigger.
The report was muffled. A strong shove, and the
door flew open. There was only one room, and it
was empty and deserted. Empty save for a litter
of rubbish at one corner, which on examination
showed signs of recent disturbance. Lieutenant
Bracewell kicked it aside, and then emitted a grunt
of satisfaction. A trap door was exposed beneath
the litter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to this side, fellows,&rdquo; he said, speaking
in a low tone, and stepping to the side of the room
which would be cut off by the upflung trapdoor
from the view of anyone ascending from the tunnel.
&ldquo;No talking now. We&rsquo;ll give them a nice little surprise
party, if they decide to come out this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE TUNNEL.</span></h2>
<p>For a little while, the space of a very few minutes,
they were silent, looking at each other. And the
hearts of the two youngest of the group beat painfully
with suppressed excitement, nor were the three
young aviators who clustered close in any better
case, as their flushed cheeks and hurried breathing
could have told. Until presently the sharp-faced
young fellow next to Bob turned his uncovered
blonde head and smiled through blue eyes while he
muttered impatiently that waiting was too tedious to
please him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; whispered Bob, at random.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; said the other&mdash;young Harincourt, who
had stayed a hundred hours in the air, part of it during
a storm of lashing rain and wind. &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;Why, what but invade the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>They spoke in so subdued a murmur that their
whisperings were inaudible to the others. Bob
stared, fascinated, into the other&rsquo;s eyes. But before
he could make comment on the daring suggestion,
there came an interruption from an unsuspected
source. The street door was flung open, and the
taxicab jehu stood in the doorway. Taut nerves
taking alarm, all in the room swung quickly about,
and Lieutenant Bracewell strode swiftly to the
other&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you took a long chance. We
might have plugged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; The chauffeur blinked as if not comprehending,
and without further comment burst out
with: &ldquo;Did yuh hear the shots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shots. What shots?&rdquo; The others crowded close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I heard two&mdash;three shots from the direction
your friends took. Thought you&rsquo;d be comin&rsquo;
out a-runnin&rsquo; but when you didn&rsquo;t I bust in to find
out why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They glanced at each other, eyes lighting with
excitement. Then young Harincourt cried breathlessly:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He started to move toward the
door, but Lieutenant Bracewell dropped a hand on
his arm, staying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Captain Murray said we should
come only in case he blew his whistle. Did you&mdash;&rdquo;
he demanded of the chauffeur&mdash;&ldquo;hear the whistle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistle? No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we stay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Young Harincourt started to protest, but Lieutenant
Bracewell silenced him with a wave of the hand.
No, more. Gripping the chauffeur by an arm, he
drew him within the room, and quickly closed the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody back in that corner behind the trap,&rdquo;
he commanded, lowering his voice to a whisper.
&ldquo;And no noise. If Captain Murray is forcing an
entrance to the house, it&rsquo;s more than likely that the
fellows he&rsquo;s after may try to escape through the
tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiptoeing, the little party, now augmented to six
with the advent of the chauffeur, regained its former
position. And for a moment none spoke but, instead,
all strained to hear any sounds that might
arise from the other side of the trap door. But no
such sound was heard, nor did whistle blast or distant
pistol shot come from without.</p>
<p>Young Harincourt stirred impatiently. Leaning
close, he whispered something in Lieutenant Bracewell&rsquo;s
ear over which the latter seemed to ponder a
moment. Then a nod of the head gave assent and
Harincourt, creeping forward soundlessly, bent
above the trap door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott,&rdquo; Bob muttered voicelessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
he&rsquo;s persuaded Bracewell to carry out that crazy
scheme. Well, if there&rsquo;s any kind of battle going
on in that house, it&rsquo;ll be a good idea to take &rsquo;em in
the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s surmise was correct. It was just such a
plan which Harincourt had proposed, and to which
Lieutenant Bracewell had given assent.</p>
<p>But even as young Harincourt bent above the trap
door, there came a sound from beneath it&mdash;a fumbling,
scratching sound. He fell back precipitately,
and the others crowded closer. The next moment
the trap began to rise. Tense with expectancy
though he was, Bob smiled as the thought occurred
to him that young Harincourt should have selected
this of all times to launch his coup&mdash;should have
waited until the very second when the enemy was
preparing to emerge. For that it was the enemy,
Bob had no doubt. Captain Murray and his aviators,
supported by Mr. Hampton and Jack, undoubtedly
had gained entrance at the front of the
house. Now Ramirez and whatever men he had
with him were fleeing through the underground
passage. So sure of this was Bob, crouching low
behind the shield afforded by the rising trap door,
that he was quite prepared to see Ramirez himself
climb out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Young Harincourt and Bob, who had sprung to
his side on divining the other&rsquo;s intention to invade
the tunnel, were the foremost members of the little
party crouching with drawn weapons behind the
trap door. They hardly dared to breath lest some
sound escape them which would give the alarm to
whoever was about to ascend. For that someone
was ascending there could be no doubt. The trap
door was not rising because of any supernatural
agency. A man&rsquo;s hand was pushing it up, and a
man&rsquo;s foot was scraping on the steps.</p>
<p>But who that man was could not be seen, for the
trap door intervened. Suddenly, however, it
slipped from the grasp of whoever was on the steps
below and fell back on the floor, almost in the faces
of Bob and Harincourt. So close did it come to
them, in fact, that they swayed backward, taken by
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; cried the man on the steps, in alarm,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t shoot. This is your little playmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he ducked beneath the level of the floor, as
he saw the leveled revolvers of the party, all pointing
directly at him.</p>
<p>It was Captain Murray.</p>
<p>For a moment, the party on guard was stunned
into silence. Then they all crowded forward, peering
down into the tunnel and crying to Captain
Murray to ascend. This he did, as soon as he
noted from their cries that he had been recognized.
And behind him came Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo; he cried, as he
gained the floor and looked around, frowning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Lieutenant Bracewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the rascals come out this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they oozed out,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>He and the others who had been on guard were
bewildered at the question, and Bob interrupted
with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you find them in the house, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Captain Murray, ignoring his question,
turned with decision and leaped down the steps into
the tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, everybody,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
time to lose. They&rsquo;re hiding out in the house somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he started running along the tunnel, flashing
the rays of an electric pocket torch ahead of
him. Not knowing what had occurred but willing
to accept the fact that a chance for action lay ahead,
Bracewell, Harincourt, the third young airman who
had been in the group in the old &rsquo;dobe hut, and
Bob, jostled each other for places in the line
behind him. But Frank drew Jack aside to ask him
what had occurred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t open to us,&rdquo; said Jack, hurriedly,
&ldquo;so we fired a couple of shots through the door and
then broke it down. Then we raced through the
house. It&rsquo;s a big place of two stories, with ten or
a dozen rooms. In one of them we found Captain
Cornell, bound and gagged. But no trace of the
others, so Captain Murray and I went down to the
cellar and found the entrance to this tunnel, without
waiting to question Cornell. Come on, let&rsquo;s
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the way being cleared by the disappearance
of young Gordon, the last of the airmen to
descend, the tunnel was now open to passage, Jack
darted down the stairs. Frank followed at his
heels. It was dark, only a faint glow, far ahead,
showing where Captain Murray&rsquo;s electric torch
headlighted the procession. The air smelled musty.
The walls were little more than a big man&rsquo;s width
apart, and the roof so low that the boys had to
stoop in order to avoid bumping their heads as they
proceeded. Ahead of them could be heard muttered
exclamations as first one and then another, in his
eagerness to make haste, ignored the necessary
caution and suffered a bump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bend down, and you&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; advised
Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a straight shoot to the other house, and
the floor is smooth. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the two boys, who had closed up on
the heels of the last of the group ahead, emerged
into a cellar where they found the others waiting
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All here?&rdquo; asked Captain Murray, flashing his
spotlight from form to form. &ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>But just as he was in the act of mounting an
open stairway to the floor above, and had, in fact,
placed a foot on the first step of the ascent, Jack
halted him with a hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Captain, what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE ENEMY STRIKE.</span></h2>
<p>In the sudden silence which fell on the group at
Jack&rsquo;s low-spoken cry, not a sound was to be heard.</p>
<p>Captain Murray shook off Jack&rsquo;s grasp on his
arm and mounted another step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hearing things, my boy. I didn&rsquo;t hear
a sound. Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation was jerked from him as, distinct,
yet faint, there came a distant thud. It
might have been the slamming of a door, or the
dropping of some heavy object. What it was, Captain
Murray did not wait to hear, but with a cry
of &ldquo;Come, come on, fellows,&rdquo; he started to bound up
the cellar steps, the bullseye of light from his torch
showing a closed door at their head.</p>
<p>After him leaped the others, crowding the narrow
stairway. But as Captain Murray reached the door
and grasped the handle, he came to an abrupt halt.
The door was locked. And as the others piled up
behind him, there came to their ears the sharp crack
of revolver shots, muffled by distance and intervening
walls and floors, from somewhere in the body
of the house above them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something funny here,&rdquo; muttered Captain
Murray. &ldquo;We left this door open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the same breath he was thrust aside and
against the stone wall on his left, while a bulky
form brushed by him on the right, along the unrailed
edge of the stairway, and went crashing,
shoulder first, into the locked door ahead. The
door reeled under the impact, but still held. However,
it was made of flimsy material and once more
the big fellow who had taken the initiative crashed
into it. The door flew outward, and the human
battering ram with it, landing on hands and knees.</p>
<p>It was Bob. He jumped to his feet as first Captain
Murray and then the others started forward
over the breach which he had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The spatter of revolver shots, heard when they
had been crowded together on the stairway, had
ceased. The house was silent about them. They
looked at each other, nonplussed. Then Jack raising
his voice shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, Dad, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment. Then from overhead came Mr.
Hampton&rsquo;s voice in reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up here, Jack. In the front room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>There was a faintness in the tone, however,
which was far from re-assuring and Jack cried
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the shooting for, Dad? You all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hollow groan was his only answer. And at
that Jack thrust aside Captain Murray, who stood
between him and a door leading from the kitchen, into
which they had emerged from the cellar stairway,
into the body of the house, and darted ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him, fellows,&rdquo; said Captain Murray, setting
the example. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack in the lead, the rout streamed through a
large room bare of furnishings as had been the
kitchen, and lighted only dimly by reason of the
fact that latticed shutters barred the several windows.
Out of this into a long hall leading to the
front door, then a sharp turn to the left and up a
boxed-in flight of stairs. Heavy boots beat a tattoo
on the bare boards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Filled with terrifying fears on account of his
father, Jack was racing madly in the lead, with
Captain Murray at his heels, followed by Bob and
Frank, and the others streaming after. At the
head of the stairway, they turned again to the left,
entering a corridor which led toward the street
front. On the left, above the dark stairway, was
a hand rail; on the right a number of doors opened
into rooms, into which those of the party who, unlike
Jack and Captain Murray, had not before been
over the ground, peered as they ran by. But the
rooms were unfurnished, except for mattresses and
crumpled coverlets seeming to cover every available
inch of floor space; and they were unoccupied, too.
The corridor ended at the open door of a larger
room than the others which faced on the street, and
into this dashed Jack, going straight, with a
strangled cry, to the form of his father. Mr.
Hampton lay on a greasy mattress, near the front
wall, and beside an open window looking out upon
the street. His face was white, and his eyes closed,
and the left shoulder of his light-colored, summer
coat was stained dark.</p>
<p>Jack had no eyes for anyone but his father, beside
whom he knelt with a choking cry which
caused the latter to open his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got away, Jack,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, painfully.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re safe, aren&rsquo;t you? I was afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice dropped to an unintelligible murmur,
and his eyelids fluttered shut again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Jack looked up, staring around wildly, as if for
help. But the others had deserted him. And then
for the first time he saw the other occupants of
the big front room. In the far corner they lay&mdash;the
two aviators who had accompanied the Hamptons
and Captain Murray into the house, and Captain
Cornell. All three were bound. Jack half rose
to his feet in astonishment. Captain Cornell had
been found bound and gagged when they first had
gained entrance to the house. But how came these
others so? When he and Captain Murray had
descended to the cellar in search of the tunnel entrance,
they had left his father on the lower floor,
and the two aviators upstairs cutting Captain Cornell&rsquo;s
bonds. He passed a hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>Well, that mystery must be left to solution by the
men loosing the bonds of the trio. His part was to
get aid for his father. He called, and Bob and
Frank broke away from the little group on the
opposite side of the room and hurried to him. An
ordinary emergency might have found Jack the
coolest of the three. But in a case such as this,
involving his father, positions were reversed. The
poor fellow was half frantic. And Bob and Frank,
with an exchange of understanding glances, elbowed
him aside and went to their knees beside
Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>The latter again opened his eyes, and as his
glance fell on them he spoke in a stronger voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bullet took me in the shoulder, boys,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it smashed the bone, although
it was a close shave. Wasn&rsquo;t that knocked me out,
but when I fell I struck the wall with my head. Cut
off my coat, so you can see what to do. Then bind
my shoulder up with something, and I&rsquo;ll manage to
survive, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice gained in strength as he proceeded,
and on concluding he struggled to sit up. Jack
with a gulp of relief got on his other side and thrust
an arm beneath him. Bob, opposite, did likewise;
and Mr. Hampton was raised to a sitting position
against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stripping for action, Frank?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hampton
with an attempt to smile that ended in a
grimace of pain. &ldquo;No use. It&rsquo;s all over. They,
got away out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank had torn off his light-weight summer coat
and now ruthlessly stripping off his white linen
shirt with a great popping of buttons ripped it in
half from collar to neckband and began tearing the
halves thus created into quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making bandages,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Peel off his coat,
fellows. Don&rsquo;t stand there like ninnies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Bob hastened to comply, easing the
wounded shoulder as much as possible, and, having
removed the coat, stripped off the shirt sleeve,
revealing a hole through the shoulder muscles, from
which the blood was slowly pumping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, now, one of you, get some water,&rdquo; commanded
Frank. &ldquo;Must be water somewhere. Jack,
you&rsquo;ve been through here. Maybe, there&rsquo;s a bathroom.
If not, there must be water in the kitchen.
If you can&rsquo;t find anything to put it in, take this cloth
and wet it well.&rdquo; And thrusting one of the long
strips into Jack&rsquo;s hands he sent him scurrying away
with a peremptory gesture.</p>
<p>With another of the linen strips, Frank wiped
the blood away from the wound in Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s
shoulder, discovering that the bullet had entered
from the rear, where there was only a bluish mark
that already had stopped bleeding, and had come
out in front. &ldquo;No sir, didn&rsquo;t smash the bone,&rdquo; he
said, thankfully, as with deft fingers he felt of the
wounded man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You were in luck, Mr.
Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was that,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;Came on
them just as they were leaving. But here&rsquo;s Captain
Murray, wanting to hear my story,&rdquo; he added
glancing up at the aviator, who, striding across the
room, was now bending anxiously above him. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know all that happened, Captain,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But between our friends over there and myself, I
guess we can piece the yarn together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">CAPTAIN CORNELL STRIKES A CLEW.</span></h2>
<p>After that it did not take long for the truth
to come out. And Captain Murray&rsquo;s impatience to
be gone rather than risk staying where the police
of Nueva Laredo were liable to come upon them,
expedited matters. What had happened was that
Ramirez and three others had fled to the roof, by
way of a trap door so cleverly concealed as to have
escaped being seen and noted by the invading
Americans.</p>
<p>Whither they had fled was unknown, however,
by Captain Cornell. Bound, gagged, flung into a
corner of the big second-floor front room, he had
known nothing of his captors&rsquo; movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so when Jack and I left the rest of you to
explore the tunnel, Ramirez and his gang came
down from the roof and jumped you?&rdquo; questioned
Captain Murray.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton nodded. His wound was causing
him pain, yet not enough to prevent him from acting
as spokesman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I left you fellows in the cellar, and then started
back upstairs. When I reached the kitchen, I was
in the act of closing the door when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; interrupted Captain Murray.
&ldquo;You did go down the cellar and see us off. I was
thinking Jack and I had gone alone and had left
that cellar door standing open. You must have
closed it, and locked it. Did you? Or did the
Mexicans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Hampton.
&ldquo;But I imagine that in my excitement I must
have locked the door. I&rsquo;m accustomed to locking
doors, anyway. It&rsquo;s a habit, and I lock a door
without giving the matter any thought. But the
Mexicans couldn&rsquo;t have done it. They didn&rsquo;t come
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! You speak of being excited. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just as I was closing the door to the cellar
I heard a dull thud coming from the floor above.
Then there was a muffled shuffling of feet, as if of
men wrestling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Quickly Mr. Hampton continued. His first instinctive
feeling, after hearing those strange noises
from the rooms above, was to shout to his companions
and ask them what was wrong? But he
resisted the impulse. He feared that in some way
the enemy had returned; and, if they did not already
know of his presence, he had no intention of
warning them. Taking off his shoes, he moved
swiftly yet soundlessly up the stairs and along the
corridor toward the front room. All the time he
could hear sounds as of men grunting and straining,
but no shouts, no exclamations.</p>
<p>And when he saw into the front room, the explanation
was made plain. The three aviators, including
Captain Cornell and his rescuers, evidently
had been taken at a disadvantage. In fact, they
here confirmed Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s assumption that
Ramirez and his assistants had stolen upon them
while Captain Cornell was being freed from his
bonds.</p>
<p>With revolvers leveled at them and under command
not to make an outcry, there was nothing
the Americans could do except to comply with the
request to put up their hands. This they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what I heard,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;was
the grunting and tugging of the Mexicans as they
busied themselves at the task of roping and gagging
our friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I had a piece of hard luck,&rdquo; he added,
with a rueful smile. &ldquo;I decided to take the Mexicans
by surprise, as obviously they had taken my
friends. If I could get the drop on them, I might
force them into a corner and hold them until you
returned. And I think I would have accomplished
it, too. They had their backs turned and didn&rsquo;t see
me. But Captain Cornell was looking my way and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I gave you away,&rdquo; interrupted the flyer,
bitterly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean, too,&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;But
something in my eyes warned Ramirez, who was
looking at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He whirled quick as a flash,&rdquo; added Mr. Hampton.
&ldquo;And he shot toward the doorway as he
turned. I jumped aside, but he caught me in the
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll say this,&rdquo; declared Captain Cornell,
admiringly, &ldquo;you were game to the core.
Why,&rdquo; he explained, turning to his friend and rescuer,
Captain Murray, &ldquo;that bullet in the shoulder,
at that close range, was enough to knock another
man down. But Mr. Hampton leaped behind the
door jam, and the next second his shots began
streaming into the room. Say, you should have seen
those rascals jump for the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble was I had to shoot with my left hand,&rdquo;
Mr. Hampton explained, &ldquo;and I was feeling weak,
besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out they all went, one after another,&rdquo; added
Captain Cornell. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a long drop from these
second-floor windows to the ground, and they took
the shortest route. I&rsquo;m sorry Ramirez got away.
But I&rsquo;m glad Mr. Hampton came when he did, for
I had the feeling that Ramirez contemplated dealing
out an unlovely fate to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest you know,&rdquo; added Mr. Hampton.
&ldquo;When the Mexicans cleared out I tried to get to
the window to take another shot at them, but managed
to get just about that far when faintness overcame
me. That&rsquo;s when you called, Jack,&rdquo; he added,
turning toward his son.</p>
<p>A quick council was held. It was decided that
the best thing for all concerned was to get back to
American soil, as soon as possible. It was not
likely that Ramirez would return. But he might
notify the Mexican police that a party of Americans
had broken into the house; and then complications
unpleasant to contemplate would arise, if the
police found them in possession.</p>
<p>There were many things still unexplained, still a
mystery. Where was Don Ferdinand? What was
the particular brand of deviltry actuating Ramirez?
Why had Captain Cornell been taken prisoner?
But these questions would have to wait for explanation.
What was of moment was that Captain Cornell
had been rescued at a cost of no wounds except
Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s, and it not serious. And the thing
to do was to get away and regain the protection of
American soil. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
when this had been agreed on. &ldquo;Jack, you&rsquo;ve got
long legs. Run around and get our taxi and bring
it here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Jack started away obediently, but was halted by
a dismayed cry from Bob: &ldquo;My flivver. My stolen
flivver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it where it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
quickly. &ldquo;I noticed it bore an American license.
When we get back to Laredo, I&rsquo;ll find out the
owner, and buy him a new car. If you undertake
to run it back across the Border, you&rsquo;ll be halted.
And then a lot of useless explanations will have to
be made. And dangerous ones, too. As for the
owner,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll not
object to getting a new car for his old one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say not,&rdquo; said Bob, fervently, thinking of the
jouncing he had received. It was a sentiment in
which Captain Cornell heartily joined.</p>
<p>Bob left with Jack, in order to thank young Juan
Salazar, who had been of such great help, and to
bind him to secrecy. During their absence a hurried
search was made of the house. There was little
furniture, only a great number of pallets scattered
through all the rooms, both upstairs and down.
There were no cabinets in which to look for papers,
which might offer some clew to the mystery of what
was Ramirez&rsquo;s occupation. And over all there hung
a perceptible odor at which the searchers sniffed
now and again, puzzled. It was elusive yet pungent,
and its origin could not be traced. But finally
Captain Murray declared with a shout that he &ldquo;had
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>The others ran up to find him standing in the
middle of the floor of an upstairs room, a number
of dirty pallets with their filthy blankets about his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what Ramirez is up to now,&rdquo; he
declared, in answer to inquiries. &ldquo;Sniff, you fellows.
Can&rsquo;t you tell what&rsquo;s in the air? It&rsquo;s the
reek of Orientals. Ramirez is smuggling again.
But this time he&rsquo;s smuggling bigger game than
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Opium?&rdquo; asked young
Harincourt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opium? No.&rdquo; Captain Cornell was scornful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but you said this smell is Oriental. And
I notice it, too, now that you call attention to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Oriental, all right. But, look around you.
See all these pallets. Fellows, this is a receiving
station for human contraband. Either Chinamen
or Japanese are bedded here until Ramirez can deliver
them across the Border in defiance of our immigration
laws. By George,&rdquo; he added, drawing a
long breath, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. I had a suspicion of it
earlier. The racket we&rsquo;ve been through rather scattered
my wits. But now that I use the old head
and put two and two together, I get the answer all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>The other nodded. Only Mr. Hampton seemed
uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Captain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That leaves
so much to be explained. Why should Ramirez have
drawn Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s workers from the mine?
How did he happen to lure away my cook, Ramon?
Don Ferdinand suspected Ramirez of working up
a revolutionary movement, you know. That&rsquo;s why
he followed Ramirez here clear from his distant
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all true enough,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell.
&ldquo;But I believe when your friend Don Ferdinand
turns up, you&rsquo;ll find out that I&rsquo;m right. However,
the cars are outside. Let&rsquo;s get back to Laredo as
quickly as the law will allow us. The bull fight will
soon be over, and if we can get across the Bridge
before the crowd hits it, we&rsquo;ll be better off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s nothing else to do now,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hampton, reluctantly joining the procession
descending the stairs. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m worried about Don
Ferdinand. I didn&rsquo;t think so much of his failure
to keep his appointment with us at the Hamilton
Hotel. But when you discover that Ramirez had
Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s car, that puts a different complexion
on the matter. He must be in captivity
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Hampton,&rdquo; said Frank, who was just
ahead of him, and who halted abruptly, &ldquo;what fools
we are. Has anybody thought to look on the
roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton and Captain Cornell looked blank.
Then sheepish smiles of comprehension dawned.
Each shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frank, turning and pressing past
Mr. Hampton, up the stairs. &ldquo;This is the only
two-story building in the neighborhood, and that
means no other building overlooks the roof. It&rsquo;s
just barely possible that we may find something of
interest up there. I&rsquo;m going to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell.
&ldquo;Mr. Hampton, will you please explain to the
others who I see have gone on. Tell them we&rsquo;ll rejoin
you shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe there are some men hiding up there,&rdquo; Mr.
Hampton said anxiously. &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be careful, all right,&rdquo; said Captain
Murray. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take us off guard a second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton. &ldquo;If
there were only some way of getting a look at that
roof without risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the others had re-ascended the stairs and
were out of earshot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">DON FERDINAND EXPLAINS.</span></h2>
<p>The trap door was on a slide, not hinged. This
permitted of its being pushed back in grooves that
proved to be well-oiled and noiseless. Frank who
stood on a stool so high that he was forced to bow
his head in order not to strike it against the low
roof was about to straighten up and look out, when
Captain Cornell thrust him aside. The next moment
the doughty flyer, placing his hands on the
edge of the opening, pulled himself up to the room.
Frank was quick to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Captain, that was mean,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want you poking into trouble,&rdquo; explained
the other. &ldquo;Feel that I owe it to Mr. Hampton.
But our trouble&rsquo;s for nothing,&rdquo; he added, looking
about, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased abruptly and leaped forward, Frank
at his heels. Both had seen that shapeless bundle,
looking like an old roll of carpet, begin to quiver.
The roof was flat, a low parapet rimming it. In
one corner lay the bundle, and the westering sun
in their eyes had so dazzled them at first that they
had not seen it. But now&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>They pulled up together beside the strange object,
and Captain Cornell stirred it with a foot.
&ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; he commanded in Spanish, &ldquo;and have
a care. I am armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faded carpet covering what they now could
see was a man out-stretched his full length, quivered.
But no man emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cover him, Frank,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell.
&ldquo;Do you take off the carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank seized an end of the carpet and tugged.
But the carpet did not come away. Instead, the
object beneath began to roll toward him. A man
was rolled up inside. Once, twice, he turned over.
Then the end of the carpet was reached, and the
man lay exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the ring-tailed caterpillar,&rdquo; cried Frank,
using his wildest expletive. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Don Ferdinand.&rdquo;
And he flung himself on his knees, and began
fumbling at the knotted rope wound &rsquo;round and
&rsquo;round the form of his old acquaintance, who was
trussed from head to heel. &ldquo;Lend a hand, Captain.
Or, wait, I&rsquo;ll cut those ropes.&rdquo; And he fished for
his pocket knife, and getting it out, opened and
began to slash the bonds. A moment later he desisted
in order to pull away the huge bandanna
knotted about the aristocratic Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s jaw
and efficiently stopping speech. The moment the
gag was withdrawn, the old Don began to sputter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Captain,&rdquo; Frank cried excitedly, &ldquo;run to
the edge of the roof and call out to the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as Captain Cornell hastened away to comply,
Frank finished the task of releasing the Don
and then assisted him to his feet. Don Ferdinand
was so stiff from his bonds as to be unable to stand
without assistance. But his tongue wasn&rsquo;t stiff.
It rattled on at a great rate. Frank, whose Spanish
was somewhat rusty from disuse, had difficulty in
understanding, so voluble was the Don&rsquo;s speech.
He knew, however, that his old friend was pouring
vials of wrath on the head of the missing Ramirez;
and he was tempted to smile, but by an effort managed
to refrain.</p>
<p>In the mean time, he assisted Don Ferdinand to
the open trap door, impressing on him that Ramirez
had fled and that friends waited below. They were
joined by Captain Cornell, who helped Frank lower
the older man to the stool below. Thereupon the two
followed, pulling the trap shut behind them. Captain
Cornell urged haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of this and get back to our own
land,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve rescued Don Ferdinand,
thanks to you Frank. It would be a shame to get
into trouble with the authorities now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Frank agreed, and with a hand under Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
elbow hurried the frothing old aristocrat
down the stairs. Not once did the latter cease his
wrathy outpourings until they emerged on the
street, where Mr. Hampton was first to greet them.
But Captain Cornell interrupted the conversation
between these two old friends before it could get
well launched. He was impatient to be gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a lot of luck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it may
not last. I don&rsquo;t know what is the standing of this
fellow Ramirez with the Mexican authorities. He
may own the town, for all I know. Anyway, it would
be a shame for us American officers to get into
trouble over here now. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went. Somehow or other, the party which
had come in the big car of the flyers and the Laredo
taxicab, augmented now by the addition of Bob and
Captain Cornell and Don Ferdinand, managed to
swarm into the constricted space. It was a wild
race for the Bridge, and so jounced about was
everybody that ordered conversation was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up at the Hamilton, everybody,&rdquo; Mr.
Hampton had said, on starting. &ldquo;Then we can
have a council of war and hear Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>So, although the car containing the flyers, drew
rapidly ahead, those in the taxi felt assured that
they would all be reunited, provided they managed
to cross the International Bridge without running
foul of the Mexican authorities. This they did,
just ahead of the procession of cars coming from
the bull fight. And in the lobby of the Hamilton,
Don Ferdinand and his escorts found the men of
the Border Patrol awaiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; said Captain Murray, as they trooped
into Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s sitting room, to the amazement
of Mr. Temple who had spent the afternoon in a
quiet siesta which their coming rudely routed;
&ldquo;that was a risky piece of business. We had no
business invading Mexico, and if we had been
caught at it by the authorities of Nueva Laredo we
would have had to do some tall explaining. Glad it&rsquo;s
over&mdash;and without exposure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget, old man,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot.&rdquo; Murray playfully pulled the other&rsquo;s hat
down over his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do as much for any
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Around the big room they all found seats, the
seven young aviators of the Border Patrol, the
Hamptons, the Temples and Frank, many sitting
on the floor. Don Ferdinand was given the seat
of honor, a huge winged arm chair. Perhaps, he
would prefer to rest after his trying experiences
rather than to talk, suggested Mr. Hampton; in
which case they would permit him to retire, and he
could relate his story later. But the old aristocrat
waved that suggestion aside impatiently. He was
filled with anger and eager to talk. Perhaps, too,
added Mr. Hampton, he was hungry and would
like to eat. But to that, too, the old Don said, no.
Mr. Hampton did, however, ring for bottled ginger
ale which when it arrived everybody eagerly
seized.</p>
<p>Then with bottles in hand, they listened while
Don Ferdinand explained how he had come to be
in the predicament from which Frank and Captain
Cornell had rescued him.</p>
<p>To begin with, Ramirez, as they already knew,
had lured away a score of men from Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
mine in the mountains, many miles to the
west. The old Don feared Ramirez was preparing
to gather a rebel army and launch a new rebellion.
At one time, nothing would have pleased Don
Ferdinand better. But he believed now that the
Obregon government was stabilizing his country,
and he wanted its peace to continue undisturbed.</p>
<p>In that isolated district, there was only a shadow
of Federal authority, in the form of a commander
and a score of troops in a small town garrison at
the village of San Dimas. Don Ferdinand decided
that it would be useless to appeal to such help, for
in the meantime Ramirez would move eastward unhampered
and continually gathering more troops.
Accordingly, with his own followers at his back, he
set out in pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Well mounted though they were, however, Don
Ferdinand&rsquo;s command failed to catch up with Ramirez.
Through sparsely settled country, where
the only human inhabitants were a few lonely
sheepherders, led the chase. Now and then Don
Ferdinand obtained word of Ramirez&rsquo;s passing.
Once, about fifty miles west of Nueva Laredo, they
came upon a camp which Ramirez had made along
the Rio Grande that was only a day old. The
American town of Carana, a Texan village inhabited
by Mexicans, was not far distant across the
river. Then they pressed on toward Nueva Laredo,
hopeful of meeting Ramirez before he could gain
sufficient strength to attack the town.</p>
<p>But almost at once Don Ferdinand discovered
that Ramirez no longer had with him the main
body of his followers. Trail signs up to the last
camp had indicated that more than a score of men
rode with Ramirez. Now the signs showed that
not more than four horsemen had proceeded from the
last camp. They turned back at once in order to
make a closer inspection of the camping place, and
soon discovered that the score left behind had
crossed the river in the direction of Carana, some
three miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>This puzzled the old Don sadly. A dozen conjectures
as to the reason for such a move whirled
through his brain. The one most likely to be true,
he believed, was that Ramirez had sent his main body
along the deserted Texan shore toward Nueva
Laredo while he and a few lieutenants approached
it from the Mexican side. Many Mexicans live in
Texas; and, therefore, the followers of Ramirez
would be able to enter Laredo without detection
and stay in the American town until they received
word from their commander to enter Mexico. In
the mean time, Ramirez could be preparing his
plans in Nueva Laredo for a surprise attack that
would put the town in his power. So Don Ferdinand
pressed eagerly toward Nueva Laredo. He
felt that this move would make the capture of Ramirez
all the easier, and that with the brains of the
revolution laid by the heels, there would be no
revolution.</p>
<p>Five miles from Nueva Laredo, Don Ferdinand
left his followers at the hacienda of a friend. Only
one man did he take with him, whose duty it would
be to act as messenger and summon the troop in
case of need. He entered Nueva Laredo the next
day and spent hours in making guarded inquiries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>No information. At least, none of value. Don
Ferdinand had acquaintances in Nueva Laredo.
His land-owning friend had others to whom he
bore references. All knew of Ramirez and his
former reputation as a smuggler and bad character.
None, however, had heard of any revolutionary
movement with him behind it, and only one had
heard of his being in Nueva Laredo. He had been
seen on the street, somebody had dropped mention
of it to this informant.</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand pressed his inquiries further.
Believing Ramirez&rsquo;s command had crossed the Rio
Grande fifty miles west in order to march into
Laredo and there await word from their commander,
he went to Laredo. A very good friend,
a wealthy merchant, housed him. But inquiries
made amid the lower strata of Laredo society by
the merchant&rsquo;s employees brought forth no information
regarding an influx of strangers who might
be Ramirez&rsquo;s men. Then, driving across the International
Bridge, Saturday night, Don Ferdinand
in his friend&rsquo;s car caught sight of Ramirez, only to
lose the chase, as already narrated, through his
accidental smashing into the taxi of his young
friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The next day was the morning of the bull fight.
Remembering his promise to call at the Hamilton
Hotel Don Ferdinand was preparing for the visit
when word was brought him that Ramirez had been
located in a house on Calle Libertad. The informant
was one of his merchant-friend&rsquo;s employees&mdash;a
laborer from the warehouse. He undertook
to guide Don Ferdinand to a dive in Nueva Laredo,
where they were to meet one of Ramirez&rsquo;s men who
had agreed to sell his information, if Don Ferdinand
would buy. The merchant was asleep. Don
Ferdinand did not wake him, but took the car
which had been placed at his disposal and drove
with his informant to the meeting place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a trick,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Barely had I
entered the dive than I was seized from behind,
gagged and then taken in my friend&rsquo;s car to the
house in Calle Libertad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ramirez?&rdquo; questioned Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the house he met me. Our conversation I
shall not repeat. It would only bore you. But,
Senor Hampton, my good friend, I must tell you I
was mistaken. This devil Ramirez, he think he have
me in his power and can tell me all. Ah, he does
not realize I have good friends who will come to my
rescue. What do you think, Senor? He says he
does not make the revolution; there is no money in
that. Instead, he organized a&mdash;what shall I call
it?&mdash;system of men for smuggling Orientals out of
Mexico into the Estados Unidos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An underground railway?&rdquo; suggested Captain
Cornell.</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was surprise&rsquo;&mdash;me. He think, this devil
Ramirez, it is I, Don Ferdinand, who want a share
in this traffic which is so profitable. He think it is
because of that desire for money that I pursue him.
So now he capture me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s listeners betrayed the keenest
interest. Captain Cornell was especially eager for
details. His suspicions regarding Ramirez and the
latter&rsquo;s projects were fulfilled. He wanted to know
all. Questions poured upon Don Ferdinand in a
flood, completely overwhelming him. At length he
waved his hands impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senors, have a patience. There is little more to
tell. This devil, Ramirez, he reveal that he take my
man from the mine because he need men for his&mdash;what
you call?&mdash;oh, yes, his underground railway.
When he send them across Rio Grande, it is that they
go to Carana and prepare. From Carana, these
Orientals shall be sent to San Antonio and then distributed
through Estados Unidos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he have other men?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Hampton. &ldquo;Why should he go west to your mine,
and take your men? Why should he take my cook
Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About thees Ramon, I do not know. But
Ramirez, he take my men because he know I shall
pursue. Me, he have a grudge against this long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">ON RAMIREZ&rsquo;S TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>Jack had been listening but at the same time his
thoughts had been busy with conjectures. To him,
it did not seem likely that Ramirez had laid his plans
solely in order that he might lure Don Ferdinand
into his power. Some other motive there must be.
And his thoughts leaped to Rafaela. With the
departure of her father and the major portion of
his men, she would be left with but slim protection
in her mountain fastness. Was it possible that
Ramirez had deliberately planned affairs so that she
should be left defenceless? He could not understand
why this supposition occurred to him, not realizing
that Rafaela was in the background of all his
thoughts of late to a greater extent than he appreciated;
but occur it did. And now he remembered,
too, that when leaving home to fly to Laredo,
he had been unable to gain a response to his radio
calls to Rafaela.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Was it possible that already evil had befallen her?
A sudden fear clutched at his heart. The others
were talking among themselves, excitedly. Snatches
of their conversation informed Jack that the aviators
of the Border Patrol were discussing this turn of
events and what it would mean for them, inasmuch
as it placed in their possession the clew to a traffic
in human contraband which would have to be broken
up. Don Ferdinand for the moment no longer occupied
the center of attention, and Jack, noting this,
slipped around behind his chair and leaning over the
back of the chair, addressed him in a low voice.</p>
<p>The old man listened a moment and then looked
up startled, while over his features came an expression
of alarm. He half started out of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I am the fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That devil
Ramirez, he have seen my daughter two-three
month ago at the fiesta and have try to kees her. My
men, they have beat him. He nurses revenge. It
is for that revenge I think he try to get me in his
power. But, no, it is that he may carry off my
daughter while I am away. Fool, fool,&rdquo; he cried,
and struck his head with his clenched fist. Then
his eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, no, Jack. If he want to carry off my daughter,
why is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, too,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;But maybe
he is trying to combine business with pleasure.
While he conducts his smuggling operations, and
lures you out of the way in pursuit of him, some
lieutenant may be swooping down and carrying
Rafaela away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand frowned, twisting his mustaches
ferociously. &ldquo;He is a devil. He is smart as Satan
himself. Perhaps, it is that you are right, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack persisted. &ldquo;Look here, Don Ferdinand.
This fellow Ramirez had a band with him before he
took your men away from the mine, didn&rsquo;t he? Well,
if he took a score from you, and that&rsquo;s about all he
brought this way with him, he must have left others
behind in the mountains. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, Jack. You are right.&rdquo; Don Ferdinand
leaped to his feet. &ldquo;Fool, fool,&rdquo; he cried again, once
more striking his head.</p>
<p>At this gesture and outburst the others gained
their feet and gathered around the pair, demanding
to know what was the matter. As briefly as he could,
Jack explained. In conclusion he added that so far
as he could see, the first thing to do was to get into
communication with Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s ranch. Radio
was the only means. Therefore, he would have to
go at once to the flying field in order to call the ranch
station.</p>
<p>The big fellow was dismayed. His handsome
features were flushed. And his father, knowing
more than the others of how Jack&rsquo;s affections were
involved, moved to his side and threw an arm across
his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Ramirez intended to
carry off Rafaela, he would have boasted of it to
Don Ferdinand when he had our friend in his
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, Dad,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;On the other hand,
Ramirez might have been saving up that choice bit
of information for a denouement. Anyhow, I
think the best thing to do is to try and get in touch
with Rafaela at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get an answer, Jack,&rdquo; Frank suggested,
&ldquo;suppose we fly out there in your plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Captain Cornell shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be
dark in another two hours,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you
couldn&rsquo;t get started under an hour from now. The
flight would take three hours. It would be folly to
make the trip in your plane, Jack. You may know
all that country well, but landing at night is a very
different matter from making a daylight landing. If
you were forced down, hm!&rdquo; He shrugged his
shoulders and spread out his hands in an eloquent
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a landing field at Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Jack expostulated. &ldquo;And nothing would go wrong
that would force me down between here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo;
he added, turning to the others, &ldquo;we have
something else to think about. Don Ferdinand,&rdquo; he
added, addressing the latter directly, &ldquo;you were in
that house longer than I. Besides, Ramirez boasted
to you of what he was planning to do. Now I saw
numerous pallets there, indicating that a good many
Orientals had slept there only recently. Did
Ramirez reveal what had become of them and when
he intended to try to smuggle them over the Border?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were taken out of Nueva Laredo last
night,&rdquo; said Don Ferdinand. &ldquo;That much, he tell
me. One was stabbed in a fight, but could walk.
They are walking toward Carana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on horseback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And he say, this devil Ramirez, that he will
put them across the Rio Grande tonight,&rdquo; Don
Ferdinand added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell, decisively. &ldquo;That
means work for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The members of the Border Patrol nodded, their
eyes bright. All but Captain Murray. &ldquo;But Ramirez
knows we&rsquo;ll be on his trail,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;He
knows we&rsquo;re in it. Otherwise, Cornell, why did he
capture you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. He was in that crowd in Nueva Laredo
last night, when Don Ferdinand and the boys and I
got together. Saw me stop Don Ferdinand and
bring him back. Then he turned around and mixed
in with the crowd. So he knew Don Ferdinand and
I were acquainted. When he saw me examining his
auto, out there in front of his house, or rather, Don
Ferdinand&rsquo;s stolen auto, he socked me. But&mdash;he
doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m an aviator, or that you fellows
who came to my rescue are aviators. I guess he&rsquo;s
still trying to figure out how you came to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Murray&rsquo;s brow cleared. &ldquo;Good. Then
he doesn&rsquo;t know that the Border Patrol is on his
trail. What a sweet surprise we&rsquo;ll spring on him at
Carana. We&rsquo;ll take your ship and mine. I&rsquo;ll telephone
the field to warm &rsquo;em up&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll be ready
when we arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the room telephone. Jack halted
him. &ldquo;Tell them to warm my ship up, too, Captain,
please,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t get Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s
daughter by radio, I&rsquo;ll have to fly over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and fifty miles,&rdquo; interrupted Captain
Cornell. &ldquo;And dark in little more than an hour
from now. You can&rsquo;t do it, Jack. Night-flying is
nothing for an inexperienced man to undertake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Anyway, you have my
ship warmed up for me, please, Captain Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the room abruptly, with the remark that
he would return in a short time, Jack went toward
his own room on the same floor. A gabble of voices
floated upstairs from the lobby, where the bull fight
of the afternoon was under discussion. Frank and
Bob, true comrades, followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get a sweater and helmet.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s lips set in a
grim line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go, we&rsquo;re going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later. Thanks, though,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they returned, the aviators were emerging into
the hall. With them were Mr. Hampton, Mr.
Temple and Don Ferdinand, all wearing anxious
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; cried Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Listen,
Jack. We&rsquo;ve decided what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two groups faced each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do, Jack, it wouldn&rsquo;t do at all, for
you to fly in your boat to Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s. Your
boat is all right, I know, a peach of a little craft.
But it isn&rsquo;t equipped with a searchlight, and it&rsquo;s too
frail to be trusted in a forced night landing. Besides,
you haven&rsquo;t any experience in night-flying. So if
it seems necessary to make a flight to Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s,
you and I&rsquo;ll go in a De Haviland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face which had been growing more and
more set in a grim look of determination, lightened
materially. &ldquo;Oh, say, Captain, that&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a white man.&rdquo; And he gripped the
other&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; Captain Cornell grunted. &ldquo;Come on,
we&rsquo;re all going out to the field. The fellows have
their car at the door, and we&rsquo;ve ordered a couple of
taxis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the hotel lobby, the group attracted considerable
attention from the various groups of old-timers and
tourists scattered about. Jack Hannaford, the old
ex-Ranger, huge, grizzled, mustached, strode up to
Captain Cornell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; he cried. Then in a lower voice, he
added: &ldquo;Looks like trouble for somebody, when
doggone near the whole Laredo flight of the Border
Patrol puts its heads together. Got something you
can let me in on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were going on. Captain Cornell was
tempted to tell Hannaford of the expedition that
was afoot. He liked the old Ranger. No harm
could be done by it. On the other hand, nothing
was to be gained. And his companions were waiting
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little expedition up the river, Hannaford,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry. Excuse me now, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannaford stepped closer and dropped his voice
still lower. &ldquo;Is it about Ramirez?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You
was asking &rsquo;bout him yestiddy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramirez?&rdquo; gasped Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Yes, Hannaford,
it is. What do you know about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; said Hannaford, in a deceptively
indifferent voice. &ldquo;Only I know where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh. Doc Garfield jist telephoned me, right here
in the lobby, that he got Ramirez in his office. The
duck come in with a bullet through his arm. Broken.
Wanted it set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hampton&rsquo;s bullet did that. Doc Garfield?
Where? Here in Laredo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh. Down near the Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns.&rdquo; The excited Captain Cornell stared
incredulously at his informant. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d this doctor
call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good friend o&rsquo; mine. Knows I got a grudge to
settle with Ramirez. Wanted to know if there was
any warrant out for him. Doc Garfield, he&rsquo;s an
old-timer. Knows these Border ruffians, most of
&rsquo;em, by sight, anyways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tol&rsquo; him? What could I tell him? Tol&rsquo; him they
was no warrants out that I knew of. But I was on
my way to light out for Garfield&rsquo;s when I see you
come inta the lobby. Jist hung up the &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannaford, listen. No, wait a minute. My
friends must hear of this. Oh, shucks, come with
me. That&rsquo;s the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell seized the old ex-Ranger by an
arm and half-urged, half-drew him out of the lobby
to the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>Two taxicabs and the big touring car from the
aviation field, his friends in them and anxious to
go, stood at the curb as Captain Cornell with
Hannaford beside him, came down the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap into it, Cornell,&rdquo; called Captain Murray,
impatiently. &ldquo;Get into one of the taxis. We&rsquo;re
loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped on the starter and the big car began
to roar. Captain Cornell cleared the sidewalk in
one jump, and landed on the running board.
&ldquo;Stop your engine. I&rsquo;ve got news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo; The excited Captain Cornell turned
toward the two taxis and waved their occupants to
approach. The three boys who were in the nearer
taxi were by his side in a moment, for they sensed
from his manner that he had something important
to divulge. The three older men who were in the
farther taxi were slower to approach. Yet they,
too, hurried their pace on noting Captain Cornell&rsquo;s
air of suppressed excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; he said, low-voiced, as the tense
group gathered around him and Hannaford, &ldquo;I
know where Ramirez is. And we&rsquo;re going for him
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he explained what Hannaford had just
revealed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry none about bein&rsquo; legal,&rdquo; said
Hannaford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a deputy sheriff, and bein&rsquo; as
how you got somethin&rsquo; on Ramirez which makes
it all right for us to go after him, I&rsquo;ll swear you all
in as members o&rsquo; my posse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hannaford, step on it,&rdquo; said Captain
Murray. &ldquo;Climb in with us, and show us the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannaford was bundled into the foremost car,
Captain Cornell joined the boys in the first taxi,
and both cars got off to an almost equal start.
That bearing Mr. Hampton and Mr. Temple and
Don Ferdinand was slower in getting under way,
but kept the others in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shoulder of mine has felt better in its
time,&rdquo; grunted Mr. Hampton to his companions.
&ldquo;I planned to wait until we got to the flying field,
where I could have the flight surgeon examine and
treat it, and wouldn&rsquo;t have to make embarrassing
explanations. But, maybe, this Doctor Garfield can
fix me up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Several minutes later found the three cars drawn
up together on a deserted side street near the
International Bridge. Hannaford had called a
halt. Doctor Garfield&rsquo;s home and office lay in the
next block, and the old ex-Ranger felt it was necessary
to prepare a plan of campaign before going
farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc Garfield was in a hurry when he phoned,&rdquo;
said Hannaford. &ldquo;I know where his phone is&mdash;in
a little room separated from his office. He was
speaking low and hurried, while Ramirez waited.
Doc couldn&rsquo;t tell me much, only that Ramirez come
in a car which he left standing at the curb, and he
thinks there&rsquo;s a woman in the car and a couple or
three men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doctor, his office it is in the next block?&rdquo;
asked Don Ferdinand. Jack Hannaford nodded.
&ldquo;It grows dusk,&rdquo; said the old Don, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added,
in a tone of conviction, &ldquo;but I am certain that ees
my friend&rsquo;s car I see.&rdquo; He pointed.</p>
<p>Twilight had come. Purple dusk lay over the
quiet street. Graceful pepper trees lining the curbing
enhanced the shadows beneath them. Yet it
was not so dark but what those who had seen it
before felt pretty certain that the car parked at the
opposite curb in the next block was that borrowed
from his friend by Don Ferdinand and stolen from
the latter by Ramirez. The shadows were growing
deeper, yet the lines of the car and the occasional
glimmer of polished trimmings could not be mistaken.
Hannaford gave confirmation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Doc Garfield&rsquo;s house is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Jack, taking the initiative.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the advantage of surprise. They won&rsquo;t
be expecting us. Let&rsquo;s dash up beside them, and
demand their surrender. We&rsquo;ll be on them before
they can know what is happening. Mr. Hannaford,
who knows the house, can lead a group inside in a
dash that ought to bag Ramirez without trouble,
especially as he&rsquo;s got a busted arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody could suggest any better plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; said Jack, addressing the
aviators, &ldquo;the car you fellows are driving better fall
to the rear. Ramirez&rsquo;s men have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrangements were quickly made, a number of
aviators transferring to the taxi previously
occupied by the older men, while Captain Cornell
took his place in that occupied by the three boys.
One was to range up alongside the stolen car, the
other to draw up behind it, whereupon its occupants
could pile out and take the gangsters on the other
side. As for Hannaford and his group, who were
to enter the house, they were to go up a side street
and approach from the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramirez may see what&rsquo;s going on out front, and
take to his heels out the back door,&rdquo; said Hannaford.
&ldquo;If he does, we&rsquo;ll bag him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>This arrangement was satisfactory to everybody
except the three older men. Mr. Hampton was regretful
because his wounded shoulder would keep
him out of action. Mr. Temple was plainly nervous
and disinclined to have the boys running into danger.
And Don Ferdinand bounced up and down,
demanding a revolver, so that he could take a hand
in the fray. But there was none to spare, and he
and his two companions were to stay in the aviators&rsquo;
car. As for the drivers of the two rented taxis,
they were not without experience in affrays of one
sort and another in this tempestuous community,
and their fares were sufficient guarantee that they
would be compensated for any damages sustained.
Moreover, they knew Jack Hannaford, whose word
with them was law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell, impatiently.</p>
<p>The discussion of details, quickly though the
latter had been arranged, had consumed several
minutes. Dusk was deepening. Jumping into the
leading taxi, Captain Cornell seated himself beside
the driver, a position which fortunately would put
him next to the car ahead. The boys were in the
rear compartment, Jack crouching by the door and
ready to throw it open and leap out at the crucial
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>In such tense moments, it is emotion, not reason,
which sways one. Certainly, Jack was in the grip
of strong emotion. Certainly, the others were, too,
as they bore down upon the car ahead. But how
different in every case! Jack was filled with rage
bordering upon despair as he thought of the possibility
that Rafaela might have come to harm
through the machinations of Ramirez. His whole
idea was to lay hands on Ramirez at the earliest
possible moment and to choke the truth out of him,
to force him to confess where he had hidden
Rafaela, if he or his lieutenants had stolen her from
her home during her father&rsquo;s absence. To none of
the others, except Rafaela&rsquo;s father, no, not even to
Jack&rsquo;s two comrades, did the affair appear in the
same light as to him. They likewise were stirred
by emotions, but only such as are incident to men
hunting a criminal, in whose evil-doing their own
personal fortunes or the fortunes of dear ones are
not involved.</p>
<p>Only a very brief space of time was required to
cover the ground intervening between the last halting
place and the field of action, and, before the two
taxis closed on the car ahead, the big car from the
aviation field, under command of Jack Hannaford,
swung into the intervening cross street. Mr.
Hampton, who was among its occupants, shook his
head as he lost sight of his son. He knew, if nobody
else did, how Jack was shaken emotionally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Hannaford pointed and, at his accompanying
word of command, the young aviator at the wheel
swung the car to the curb. Then the grizzled old
Texan and the aviator&mdash;it was young Harincourt
who had been detailed to this task&mdash;leaped out.
Quickly he outlined his plan.</p>
<p>They were at the mouth of an alley running along
the rear of Doctor Garfield&rsquo;s house. Hannaford
and young Harincourt would enter the house from
the rear. Mr. Hampton, Mr. Temple and Don
Ferdinand were to keep guard at the alley&rsquo;s mouth.
If Ramirez escaped Hannaford and came down the
alley, it would be their job to pot him. Don Ferdinand,
raging, protested. He wanted to be in the
forefront.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Hannaford brusquely.
&ldquo;More would git in their own way. You stay here.
Come on, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with Harincourt at his heels, the old ex-Ranger
darted up the deserted narrow alley, in
which the shadows were deepening at the near approach
of night, as briskly as a boy.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton shook his head in admiration, a
little smile on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tough breed,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>In the meantime, up the shadowy street in front
of the house, with its air of Sabbath calm, sped the
two taxis, while peal on peal of bells from the
tower of a nearby church floated down on the still
air. What irony, thought Jack, church bells and
he and his comrades speeding on such a mission!
Yet their mission was of the best, he comforted
himself.</p>
<p>And then all thought except of the matter in
hand fled, crouching against the door, ready to fling
it open and spring out, his eyes, just tipping the rim
of the panelled glass, beheld the other car at the
curb, ahead, abreast. Now, now. As the brakes
squeaked, and the taxi ground to a stop so suddenly
as to fling all its occupants about, Jack thrust the
door outward and sprang upon the running board
of the other car, pistol in hand. Beside him was
Captain Cornell, leaping down from the driver&rsquo;s
side, and at his back Bob and Frank, crowding
close.</p>
<p>But what was this revealed in the depths of that
other car? What, but one man struggling desperately
yet unavailingly in the grasp of another?
And of a third man cowering in a corner, with his
upflung arms protecting his face, while over him
bent a fury in woman&rsquo;s clothes, one hand gripped
in his hair and the other reaching talon-like for his
features?</p>
<p>Ramon, the Hamptons&rsquo; old cook, face distorted.
&ldquo;Senor Jack, queek or he escape. I&mdash;cannot&mdash;hold&mdash;heem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>And then Captain Cornell&rsquo;s pistol butt falling on
the head of him whom Ramon clasped, and the
other lying still and Ramon rising to his knees with
a sob of thankfulness.</p>
<p>And then, wonder of wonders, the fury faced
about, and it was Rafaela. Rafaela, her face appearing
as through a mist to Jack&rsquo;s unbelieving eyes.
And quick as thought he threw an arm about her
and drew her close, while all the fighting fury
which had nerved her to the attack went out of her,
and she collapsed with a little trembling cry. And
Bob and Frank, over there, on the other side of the
car&mdash;though how they got there was a mystery to
Jack!&mdash;sitting on the form of the ruffian whom
Rafaela had faced and outfaced and at their back,
only half-seen in the growing darkness, the other
aviators from the second taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all over? Anybody hurt?&rdquo; the young
aviators demanded.</p>
<p>But Jack could think of nothing except that here
was Rafaela whom he had thought far away, and
safe in his arms, when he had feared she was in
Ramirez&rsquo;s power. Safe in his arms&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>For the first time he was aware of the broad
grins upon the faces of his two comrades, and the
scarcely less-pronounced smiles of his Border
Patrol friends. He knew the reason, but he merely
pressed Rafaela tighter in the circle of his arm. It
was she who pulled away, with a &ldquo;Thank you,
Senor, but I can stand now.&rdquo; And then&mdash;they
were now in the street between car and taxi&mdash;the
little witch must needs add, as if utterly surprised,
&ldquo;Oh, it is you, Jack.&rdquo; And Jack, looking no more
foolish than he felt, could only add, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I.
Who&mdash;who did you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grins became broader, someone laughed.
Rafaela only shrugged.</p>
<p>Across the embarrassment cut Captain Cornell&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;Tie &rsquo;em up, boys, and into the house,
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Senor, not Ramon,&rdquo; protested Rafaela,
facing the group about the volubly expostulating
cook. The two other captives were sullen and
silent. &ldquo;He have been of a help to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Jack,&rdquo; Ramon held out supplicating
hands.</p>
<p>Jack hesitated, but the old cook&rsquo;s appeal coupled
with a glance from Rafaela decided him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer
for Ramon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And Bob, remembering the old cook&rsquo;s recalcitrance
toward Ramirez outside the bull ring that
afternoon&mdash;was it only a few short hours before?&mdash;spoke
up with, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right. Let&rsquo;s beat
it into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>A swirl and a whoop, a patter of running feet,
and away dashed the others, up the walk toward
Doctor Garfield&rsquo;s house behind a wide lawn. The
two hastily yet securely-trussed captives lay on the
sidewalk, with Ramon leering about them, lighting
a cigarette. The taxi driver looked down interestedly
from his seat at the two young people standing
so close to each other between his cab and the
other car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, rats,&rdquo; he muttered, but grinning as he
spoke the words. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they the sweet young
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he climbed down stiffly and walked around
on the other side of his taxi to talk to his brother
chauffeur in the other car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">RAMON TALKS.</span></h2>
<p>The rest can be briefly told. When the reserves,
so to speak, entered Doctor Garfield&rsquo;s office,
they found Ramirez already captive in Hannaford&rsquo;s
clutches. The Mexican had been in the act of departing,
he was, in fact, already at the front door,
his hand on the knob, when the old Texan from
the rear had commanded him to surrender.</p>
<p>Don Ferdinand, raging, had broken away from
the restraint of Mr. Hampton and Mr. Temple,
and had followed in the wake of Hannaford and
young Harincourt. He stood, trembling with passion,
in front of Ramirez, as the aviators under
Captain Cornell, and ably supported by Bob and
Frank, appeared in the doorway of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter?&rdquo; he was demanding, shaking his
fist under Ramirez&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Where is my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the latter, his evil eyes gleaming from his
swarthy face, was leering down at the smaller man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where you cannot find her,&rdquo; he was saying, for
he believed that his shout of warning, emitted as
Hannaford captured him, had been heard and
heeded by the captors of Rafaela who were in the
car outside.</p>
<p>But the malicious triumph that shone from his
eyes departed when his attention was drawn by the
loud trampling of feet in the hall and he swung
around to face newcomers in the doorway. If these
were more Americans from the front of the house,
it was likely that his men had been captured and
Rafaela rescued, was the thought that followed.
And this suspicion of the downfall of his rascality
was confirmed when Bob stepped up to Don Ferdinand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe him, sir,&rdquo; said the big fellow.
&ldquo;Your daughter is safe outside. Jack is with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words fell on unheeding ears. Don
Ferdinand went through the crowd and out the hall
like an arrow.</p>
<p>Much had been done, but something still remained.
Ramirez and several of his lieutenants
had been captured, and Rafaela rescued. But a
score of Ramirez&rsquo;s followers were still at large, and
the large band of Orientals whom Ramirez was
smuggling into the United States in defiance of the
immigration laws would have to be rounded up before
the Border Patrol would consider its efforts a
complete success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; Captain Cornell hurriedly
explained to Jack and his comrades; &ldquo;the new immigration
law which is under discussion in Congress
right now proposes a practically complete ban
of Orientals. Few enough have been admitted
heretofore, the majority being permitted to enter
under a so-called gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement, and posing
as students. Well, some have been students,
but certainly not all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you are not familiar with
what is going on, I can tell you that our government
is preparing to frame a law which will make
it impossible for Orientals to enter our country.
There have been frequent rumors of late to the
effect that the Orientals were leaving their crowded
home lands and migrating to Mexico, where there
is no ban against them, in large numbers. Doubtless,
Ramirez, who has a head on his shoulders,
even if he does use it only for rascality, and who
keeps abreast of the times, saw his opportunity in
this situation. He has planned an &lsquo;underground
railway&rsquo; for running Orientals out of Mexico and
into the United States. There used to be a traffic
in the same sort of human contraband on the
Pacific Coast, until it was broken up a few years
ago. But,&rdquo; he interrupted, surprised, &ldquo;why these
knowing looks at each other?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>His listeners laughed. &ldquo;You tell him, Jack,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;you may not believe
it, but we three happened to have a hand in
breaking up that traffic. And a sweet time we had
of it, too, for a while. By accident, we stumbled
on something in San Francisco which made us dangerous
to the Smuggling Ring. They kidnapped
us and took us to sea. But we managed to escape
and to bring the government forces down on their
hiding place in the Santa Barbara Channel islands.
Fellows,&rdquo; he added, addressing Bob and Frank, &ldquo;do
you remember that inventor&mdash;Professor What&rsquo;s-his-name,
and his radio finder for locating uncharted
stations? That&rsquo;s how we managed to find
the hiding place, Captain, through locating their
radio calls between a shore station and their boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were the happy days,&rdquo; said Bob reminiscently,
and a faraway look came into his eyes
as his thoughts turned back to the exciting events
narrated in The Radio Boys on Secret Service
Duty.</p>
<p>Frank nodded. &ldquo;Lots of fun,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Captain Cornell threw up his hands in mock dismay,
as he laughed. &ldquo;You three must be regular
trouble-finders,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Do you always
get into the thick of things like this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not always,&rdquo; said Jack. And Bob grumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thick of things? Huh. We aren&rsquo;t in the thick
of things this time. You fellows flying to Carana
are going to get the cream of the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation had been conducted in undertones.
All four were standing on the outskirts of
the group in Doctor Garfield&rsquo;s office, which was
brilliantly lighted while in one corner Captain
Murray, finding he could obtain little information
from the sullen Ramirez, was now pumping Ramon.
Don Ferdinand had taken Rafaela to the
home of his merchant friend, and the boys were to
call on them on the morrow. Doctor Garfield had
re-dressed Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s wound, and the latter
had departed for the hotel, accompanied by Mr.
Temple, for the express purpose of trying to locate
the owner of the flivver which Bob and Captain
Cornell had made off with outside of the Nueva
Laredo bull ring that afternoon, in their pursuit of
Ramirez, and of reimbursing him.</p>
<p>The other aviators were listening to Captain
Murray&rsquo;s attempt to obtain information from Ramon.
Presently the latter turned away impatiently,
and, his eyes lighting on Jack, he beckoned him forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hampton, I can&rsquo;t get anything out of your old
cook. You try your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ramon,&rdquo; said Jack, eyeing the old
fellow keenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid of something. You
know you&rsquo;ll not be prosecuted. You did us too
good a turn outside for that. Now what is it?
Tell me. Are you&rdquo;&mdash;and he leaned closer, whispering
so that only Ramon could hear&mdash;&ldquo;afraid of
what Ramirez may do if you betray any information
about his plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, Senor,&rdquo; breathed Ramon.</p>
<p>Jack in turn whispered to Captain Murray. The
latter frowned thoughtfully for a second or two,
then his eyes brightened, and he turned to Hannaford.
The other stooped from his greater height,
and the three put their heads together. The other
Americans regarded them curiously. As for Ramirez
he continued to glower while from beneath
his lowered lids darted a poisonous glance which
fell on Ramon and made the old fellow tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you,&rdquo; said Hannaford, at length, turning
to Ramirez; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just put you where you
won&rsquo;t be no trouble to anybody but yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a hand as big as a ham gripping the more
slightly built Mexican, Hannaford marched him
outside and flung him into one of the taxicabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;County jail. Step on &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Behind them, in the office, already Ramon was
growing brighter, with Ramirez away. And now
he no longer hesitated to answer questions, for Jack
assured him that Ramirez would be sent to the
Federal Penitentiary for violation of a national law,
and that years would elapse before he would ever
be free again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Jack,&rdquo; said Ramon, addressing Jack in
Spanish, &ldquo;you ask yourself why Ramon abandons
you at the ranch? Ah, you do not know, you do
not know that devil&rsquo;s power? Once I was a bandit;
that was years ago. Then I went to the Estados
Unidos and became respectable. Senor, when I go
to the village that day to buy supplies for our
ranch, two lieutenants of Ramirez encounter me.
Aye, Senor, those same two&mdash;Andreas and Jose&mdash;whom
I fight and overcome in the car, myself,
alone, single-handed, as you arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thumped his chest, and Jack with difficulty
restrained a burst of laughter. From behind him,
where the others crowded close, came a tittering
which betrayed that others were not so heedful of
the old man&rsquo;s feelings. But Ramon paid them no
heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andreas and Jose tell me they have a fine job
for me, Senor Jack, and when I decline and inform
them I already have the fine job, they compel me
to go with them. Of a certainty, I, Ramon, would
have fought them then, except that they were
armed while I had not even a knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;We get in the train, Senor, and we ride to
Laredo. And then they take me to that house you
know of, where they make me cook for thousands
of stinking Orientals. And, Senor, Ramirez, he
laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man bowed his head in shame, and this
time no laughter came from the men crowding close
behind Jack. The latter dropped a kindly hand on
Ramon&rsquo;s bowed shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now, Ramon, and he shall never get
you in his clutches again,&rdquo; Jack promised. &ldquo;And
now,&rdquo; he added, at an impatient whisper from Captain
Murray, &ldquo;tell us where the Orientals are, and
how they are to be brought into the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor, tonight at midnight, they are to be at a
point forty miles west, on the Rio Grande. A
rough trail leads there, and it is wild country. At
midnight, boats will meet them and they will be
ferried across the river from Mexico into Texas.
Guides will take them to Carana, where they will
be housed until tomorrow night, when they will be
sent on to San Antonio. There are no Americans
at Carana, Senor, only Mexicans; and the whole
town, which is not large, is in Ramirez&rsquo;s pay or, else,
fears him and keeps silent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>And once more Ramon ceased speaking, while
his hands went patting here and there about his
person, but without success, until one of the aviators
with a smile stopped his fruitless search by
thrusting a packet of cigarettes into his hand. The
old man gratefully accepted one, lighted it, and sat
back, puffing.</p>
<p>Captain Murray walked to an open window and
looked out. Then he turned back with a decisive
set to his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As calm a night as one could desire,&rdquo; he said to
his confrere, Captain Cornell. &ldquo;Three hours to
midnight. And we could reach Carana in less than
an hour. I know the village. Nobody there to
telephone to, nobody to put on guard. What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve landed there, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In bright moonlight like this, there&rsquo;s no
chance to miss it. A little settlement where the river
takes that big bend to the north. Several good fields
nearby. And in this flood of moonlight, landing
ought to be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were listening closely, and the atmosphere
was tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those Orientals once get into Texas, they&rsquo;ll
be as hard to round up as jackrabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if we break up Ramirez&rsquo;s gang, there&rsquo;ll
be no boats for the Orientals to cross in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking. Three ships ought
to be enough, two in each.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;ll telephone the field to warm &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;
And Captain Murray turned to white-haired old
Doctor Garfield, who like the others, had been an
interested listener, and asked him for the location
of his telephone. The Doctor silently threw open
a door, and switched on the light in the next room,
and Captain Murray sat down to the phone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">JACK SURRENDERS TO THE &ldquo;ENEMY.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Anybody strolling into the dining room of the
Hamilton Hotel after the dinner hour three nights
later would have seen an amusing sight. The big
room was being prepared as if for another dinner,
when, as everybody knew, the regular diners had
all been and departed. Nevertheless, instead of
waiters clearing the tables and porters mopping up,
here were the employees of the fashionable caterer
of the town directing the waiters in assembling the
tables down the center of the room into one long
table, some putting on snowy linen and setting out
silver and plate and flowers, others placing banks
of flowers along the walls.</p>
<p>Rangy old Jack Hannaford, looking vastly different
and uncomfortable in black coat and white
collar, peered into the room and then precipitately
withdrew. In his retreat he bumped into several
other old-timers, likewise bent upon viewing the
metamorphosis of the dining room, and they chaffed
him unmercifully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him all duded up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;ta knowed ye, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. That ain&rsquo;t Jack Hannaford. That&rsquo;s an
undertaker. Where&rsquo;s the corpse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that is mistaken. He&rsquo;s the corp himself.
See how white he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last witticism drew a roar of appreciative
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think ye&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; said Jack, beginning
with dignity and ending in companionable
mirth. &ldquo;Waal, fellers, I look like I feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was going to the &ldquo;party.&rdquo; So were seven
spruce young men in white ducks donned by command
invitation instead of their hot uniforms, who
entered the lobby at that moment. The foremost
saw Hannaford and hailed him, and the old Texan
at once deserted his tormentors to join the newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo;s sit down, boys,&rdquo; invited Hannaford, &ldquo;nobody
but ourselves ain&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With comfortable sighs, all eight sank into chairs
which were drawn in a semi-circle. Jack looked
around the group. None of the aviators with
whom he had shared the honor of Ramirez&rsquo;s capture
and the rounding-up and scattering of the Smuggling
Band was absent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen you since that night, Captain,&rdquo; said
Hannaford, his deep voice booming as he sought
ineffectually to modulate it, and addressing himself
to Captain Cornell. &ldquo;We got a minute&rsquo;s time before
the party begins. Lay &rsquo;er out for me. What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So then Hannaford was told of how three De
Havilands, each with its crew of two men, had gone
cruising through the moonlight of that memorable
night, high above the silvery reaches of the Rio
Grande, to a landing near Carana; how there the
members of the Border Patrol, commandeering a
battered flivver, had piled into it and departed
down river in time to round up a full dozen of Ramirez&rsquo;s
band before ever a boat had put out across
the river for the purpose of transferring the Orientals
into the United States, and had sent the
others flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the rest, Jack,&rdquo; said Captain Cornell.
&ldquo;The fellows that we rounded up were all Mexicans
lured from Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s mine by Ramirez with
specious promises of the much gold they would receive.
They&rsquo;re still in jail, but I expect that Uncle
Sam will make it easy for them, inasmuch as they
were not caught in the act and as they had not yet
brought Orientals into the country. Besides, Don
Ferdinand needs them back at his mine, and he and
the Mexican Consul are making representations
which ought to carry weight. How about Ramirez?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;With him and his two lieutenants,&rdquo; Hannaford
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some different. We got enough on
&rsquo;em to hang &rsquo;em. And good riddance, too, if it
could really be done&mdash;but it cain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cornell laughed. &ldquo;You bloodthirsty old
villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hannaford did not even smile. &ldquo;I know him,
you don&rsquo;t. Listen, let me tell you, it&rsquo;s a mighty
good thing them boys took a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the real stuff, Jack,&rdquo; Captain Cornell
agreed heartily, and his companion nodded. &ldquo;The
real stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But, say, Jack, what&rsquo;s
the reason for their giving us this party tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannaford looked mysterious but confessed
ignorance. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fool yourselves
none. This party ain&rsquo;t bein&rsquo; give for us, or
I miss my reckonin.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re only the lookers-on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns,&rdquo; cried Captain Cornell, half rising
from his chair, and gazing toward the doorway.
&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes followed his gaze. And, truly, the
vision entering the lobby was worth attention. It
was Rafaela, leaning on her father&rsquo;s arm, but a
Rafaela so gloriously beautiful and so quaintly
dressed in Spanish costume&mdash;or was it merely a
touch here and there, such as the lacy black mantilla,
which made her costume appear so much more
picturesque than that of the more Americanized
beauties who followed her?&mdash;that she took away
the collective breath of the entire group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Across the lobby Don Ferdinand, impeccably
clad in dinner clothes, saw the standing group of
aviators clustered about Jack Hannaford, and with
a word to Rafaela, he made his way toward them.
And then while the aviators gallantly professed
themselves captivated, and while Rafaela and her
attendant beauties blushed and bowed as prettily as
ladies of the Sixties, introductions finally were
achieved. Strangely enough, there was a beauty
for each, with a handful left over. Even Jack
Hannaford, confirmed old bachelor, groaned inwardly,
as he saw a duenna&mdash;the counterpart of
Donna Ana, Jack could have told him&mdash;being
gently manoeuvred his way.</p>
<p>And Jack, where was he? And Bob and Frank?
Ah, there! Coming down the stair; at their heels,
Mr. Hampton and Bob&rsquo;s father. Nor could any of
the group, watching the approach across the lobby,
guess that for the last hour tall, curly-haired Jack
Hampton had been dressing with more painstaking
preparations than he had ever bestowed on this
operation before in his life. Nor could any have
guessed that during that time he had been the target
of unmerciful chaffing on the part of his chums&mdash;until
at length he had attempted to expel them from
his room, and a tussle had ensued, and he had been
compelled at the end to undertake dressing all over
again, for it had left him a ghastly ruin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>No, none of these things could have been surmised
from his appearance. For, fortunately, he
had not yet donned dinner jacket and vest when the
tussle had begun.</p>
<p>A merry clatter of voices rose as the two parties
met and mingled, only to be temporarily stilled
when Mr. Hampton announced that they would move
into the dining room. So in they poured, each
gallant aviator doing his best to be a ladies&rsquo; man,
with a Creole beauty on his arm, and Bob and Frank
in the same case, while Jack walked beside Rafaela
and neither spoke a word, yet eyes were far more
eloquent than any speech could have been. And
last of all came the three elders of the party&mdash;while
the fourth, the real elder of all, old Jack Hannaford,
strode fiercely just ahead of them, with the
duenna&rsquo;s fingers resting on his high-crooked arm.</p>
<p>The room was a blaze of light. The decorations
miraculously had all been arranged. And down the
center, under its canopy of snowy linen, with the
silver gleaming and sparkling, ran the long table.
Place cards? Yes, here they were. And amid much
laughter the various couples found their places.</p>
<p>Then silence, while Mr. Hampton at the head of
the table, looking impressive and yet mischievous,
lifted his glass&mdash;of sparkling grape juice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;under other circumstances,
the announcement I am about to make would come
in an utterly different way. But the people involved&mdash;oh,
yes, there are people involved&mdash;lead
such scatterbrain lives that the customary manner
of announcing engagements must be a bit scatterbrained,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob and Frank, standing beside their partners
across the table from Jack, looked pointedly at him
and Rafaela, grinning widely the while. And in
the little pause following Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s last
words, the aviators who had been unaware of what
was coming and felt sadly puzzled, caught the significance
of that glance. Jack tried to grin back manfully,
but it was what his two comrades privately
considered a sickly attempt. As for Rafaela, she
looked as demure and unconcerned as if not she,
but some other of the beautiful girls nodding to her
with parted lips, was about to be named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you to drink,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hampton, &ldquo;to
my son and his affianced bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, the secret was a secret no longer. And in
the hubbub that followed, with girls crowding
around Rafaela, and the men about Jack, telling
him what a lucky fellow he was, the dinner bade
fair to be forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>But suddenly a waiter wearing an anxious frown
appeared at Mr. Hampton&rsquo;s elbow, apologetically
but firmly pleading for a hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that crazy fella you says must be master of
ceremonies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He says you must go on
with the dinner or it will be spoiled. He&rsquo;s out there
in the kitchen, tearin&rsquo; around like wild. I says no
good would come of havin&rsquo; one o&rsquo; these Spanish
chefs in the kitchen, bossin&rsquo; everybody. There,&rdquo;
pointing toward the kitchen door&mdash;&ldquo;there he is
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton, lips quirked in a smile, let his gaze
travel down the room. In the kitchen door, outlined
against the gleaming ranges beyond, stood a
figure, arms akimbo. Mr. Hampton said to the
waiter, &ldquo;All right, tell him to begin.&rdquo; And to the
distant figure, he waved a hand, a signal which the
latter apparently understood, for he disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon says we must begin dinner,&rdquo; Mr.
Hampton announced, turning to Don Ferdinand on
his right. And he rapped on the table, and made a
similar announcement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all have to sit
down and be good,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;or the old fellow&rsquo;s
heart will be broken. He wouldn&rsquo;t let anybody, not
even the caterer, oversee this dinner but himself.
Says he owes it to Jack for lifting from him a load
that oppressed him for years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>It was a hot June day when little more than a
month later, two commodious limousines keeping
close together rolled along the last few miles of the
Boston Post Road, coming from the South,
and entered New Haven. How strange and yet
familiar seemed the streets of the famous college
city to the lithe, sunburned young fellow at the
wheel of the foremost car. This way and that
darted his glance, as the car passed Poli&rsquo;s and many
another place enshrined in memories and traditions,
and he was kept continually busy pointing out landmarks
to the dark olive-tinted beauty beside him.</p>
<p>It was still early in the day, for they had left
New York at an early hour. But already the crush
of automobiles coming and going in the streets was
dense. And as they drew near a great green square
resembling a public park, in the very heart of the
business section, the traffic became so dense and
slow-moving that the young fellow was compelled
to give all his attention to his driving and to crawl,
start, stop continually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>It was on his companion that the first sight of
the noble group of buildings, wide-stretching amid
stately elms, on the other side of the green square,
dawned. She clutched his arm, while her eyes
opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, how you must love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh,&rdquo; grunted Jack, casting one swift look
toward the dear familiar buildings of Old Eli.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t grab me like that again, please, or we&rsquo;ll
be crawling up on top of this car ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few blocks farther, on a side street, Jack
rolled into a garage already almost filled with cars
and, while he was assisting Rafaela to alight, the
second car drew in. From it stepped Mr. and Mrs.
Temple and Mr. Hampton. From the first car Jack
helped out Don Ferdinand and then Bob&rsquo;s sister,
Della. A slim, charming girl, with the springy step
and quick yet graceful movements of a veteran
tennis player, she well merited all the devotion
which Frank Merrick showered on her. During
Rafaela&rsquo;s week in New York, shopping for her
trousseau, a warm friendship had grown up between
the two girls. Della&rsquo;s chum, Marjorie, to whom
big Bob had of late been paying marked attentions,
was already in New Haven, and would meet them
later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now to find the fellows,&rdquo; said Jack, when all
were assembled. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no getting around
the streets in a car in this crowd, which is why I
brought you here. Come on, fall in line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chattering gaily, the little party set out with Jack
leading, Rafaela clinging to his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather old-fashioned, Mother, for a girl to
lean on a man&rsquo;s arm like this,&rdquo; whispered Della in an
undertone. &ldquo;But I like it. I think she&rsquo;s charming,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Southern girls,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Temple in
the same guarded tone, &ldquo;I always did consider them
more attractive than you mannish young women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Della laughed lightly, nor felt any hurt.
She knew none was intended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Tubby Devore,&rdquo; she cried the next
moment. And running forward, she gripped Jack&rsquo;s
free arm and pointed. &ldquo;Jack, Jack, there&rsquo;s Tubby
Devore, and Johnny Malcolm, and Pinky Atwell,
and&mdash;and&mdash;why, there are Frank and Bob. Oh,
call to them, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Whereat Jack raised his voice, and in a moment
the group thus hailed came plunging through the
crowd, to surround the newcomers, pay their laughing
respects to Della&mdash;an old acquaintance&mdash;and to
slap Jack thunderously on the back and hail him as
&ldquo;Benedict.&rdquo; To all of which Jack appeared
brazenly indifferent, and presented each in turn to
Rafaela, &ldquo;who,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is soon going to have an
awful job on her hands. Give her your pity lads.
She&rsquo;s going to look after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if we were to follow our friends throughout
the festivities and occasions of that and succeeding
days, we would need another book or two. It was
Commencement Week, and New Haven was going
through its annual madness. Enough to say that
indoors or out, at dance or tea or in the Bowl, Jack
everywhere came in for attention as a distinguished
young alumnus whose radio research already was
bringing him and the institution fame, while
Rafaela with her Spanish beauty offset by a ravishing
accent and a spirit of mischief forever lurking
beneath the surface was acclaimed by all Jack&rsquo;s
friends as a jolly good sort, indeed. As for big
Bob, it was with genuine regret that those old
alumni who followed Yale sports from season to
season spoke of his graduation. He was leaving a
record in practically all departments of athletics
which everybody considered would remain unsurpassed
for a long time to come. And Frank&rsquo;s graduation
equally was a matter for regret, among the
undergraduate body especially, inasmuch as he had
endeared himself to its members by his democratic
spirit and charm of manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>At length, however, all good things must end,
and it was so with Commencement Week. The day
came when New Haven was only a memory, and
all our friends were back in New York, though
not in New York City, but on the adjoining Hampton
and Temple estates near Southampton. Ahead
of the young folks lay a long Summer with the
prospects of gay companions coming and going,
tennis, yachting, motor boating on the waters of
Great South Bay and the broad Atlantic, golf and
dancing, motoring and horseback riding. Della
who was a born manager had taken charge of
affairs, and had planned a round of gayeties leading
up to the approaching marriage of Jack and
Rafaela. The latter and Don Ferdinand were guests
of the Temples. And, of course, in between everything
else and, in fact, forming at first the major
attraction for at least two members of the party,
were the innumerable visits to New York paid by
the two girls and Mrs. Temple in pursuit of that
elusive thing known as &ldquo;Rafaela&rsquo;s trousseau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many times did the swift-moving events at
Laredo and at Don Ferdinand&rsquo;s Mexican estate
come up for discussion, and every item of occurrences
had to be rehearsed time and again, with the
exception of how Rafaela had been captured and
conveyed to Laredo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>By tacit consent, that was never brought up for
discussion because of the horrors surrounding it in
Rafaela&rsquo;s recollection. It was known that a lieutenant
of Ramirez&rsquo;s, who had been hiding in the hills
near the estate, had swooped down the day after
Jack and his father had concluded their brief visit,
and, after smashing the radio station, had carried
Rafaela off from under the eyes of the few peons
left behind by Don Ferdinand and Pedro and
from the despairing clutches of Donna Ana. More
dead than alive, the poor girl had been swept up
into the hills. But when she found that whatever
fate was intended for her was to be deferred until
she could be transported on horseback to Nueva
Laredo and turned over to Ramirez, her courage
and resourcefulness revived. She watched for an
opportunity, and, when on arrival at Nueva
Laredo, she found Ramon in almost as sad plight
as herself, she instantly began working to bring the
old fellow around to the point of helping her escape.
The two, as we know, were in the act of carrying
out their desperate attempt when Jack fortunately
and opportunely arrived with his comrades and the
aviators to rescue her.</p>
<p>But, of the tortured hours that lay between the
sudden attack of the bandits on her home and
Jack&rsquo;s arrival, she could never be persuaded to talk,
and so, by common consent, the matter was never
pressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>One day during this golden vacation period Jack
went into New York, not returning until the next
day. Then he arrived jubilant. He had come
straight from hours spent with the chief engineers
and officials of the great radio trust, and so fulsome
had been the praise heaped on his young head on
account of the successful outcome of his year&rsquo;s experiments
that modesty forbade him to repeat more
than a tithe of it. Indeed, many another head&mdash;and
many a good deal older than Jack&rsquo;s&mdash;might
have been turned; but his sat too squarely, he saw
too sanely for conceit to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>Enough to say that all Jack&rsquo;s work had been fully
approved, and that he would soon have the pleasure
of seeing his improved radio equipment on the
world market. He had solved the problem of providing
super-selectivity with a radio receiver permitting
the operator to select any station he wanted
to hear, whether or not local stations were in operation&mdash;a
receiver that brought volume from distant
stations along with selectivity, that attained a more
faithful reproduction of broadcasted voice and
music than ever deemed possible before, and that,
moreover, was eternally &ldquo;non-radiating;&rdquo; that is to
say, that no matter how handled it would never interfere
with a neighboring radio enthusiast&rsquo;s enjoyment.
And he had transformed the Super-Heterodyne,
theretofore so complicated that engineering
skill was required for its operation, until
now it was improved in sensitiveness and selectivity
and simplified so that anybody could operate it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you get for your work?&rdquo; the practical
Mr. Temple wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Maybe, millions.
The radio trust financed my experiments, as you
know, and you might think it would now offer me
a lump sum and buy my work outright. But, although
there were one or two men who wanted to
do that, the balance were very decent about it. The
upshot is that I have a contractual agreement, paying
me a fixed royalty on all sales of my patented
articles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got them to do that?&rdquo; said Mr. Temple,
getting up and shaking Jack by the hand. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re a business man. How about it,
Hampton?&rdquo; And he turned toward Jack&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack knows how I feel,&rdquo; said Mr. Hampton,
smiling. &ldquo;But the big thing to him, and I guess to
me, too, is not the fact that he probably will reap
a fortune but rather that he has succeeded in advancing
the cause of science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what are you planning to do?&rdquo; persisted
Mr. Temple, while the others&mdash;the whole
party was present on the shaded slope of lawn beside
the Temple tennis courts&mdash;listened for Jack&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Jack pretended a secretiveness which he did not
feel, and his make-believe was so pronounced that
the others all began to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist,&rdquo; he said, gazing around, with hand, palm
extended, shading his eyes. &ldquo;Any enemies of the
radio trust on hand? No, well then I can speak.
But only in strictest secrecy, mind that, everybody.
As soon as&rdquo;&mdash;a twinkling glance at Rafaela&mdash;&ldquo;as
soon as I go under new management, I&rsquo;m to be detailed
to Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington? What for?&rdquo; cried Bob.</p>
<p>And, &ldquo;Yes, what for?&rdquo; echoed others. Mr.
Hampton and Rafaela, who already had been admitted
to the secret, alone remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man down there who also has been
experimenting on radio,&rdquo; Jack said, &ldquo;but along
different lines. He is trying to find out the laws
controlling radio waves for the transmission of
vision. Well, maybe, I didn&rsquo;t put that just right.
But this is what he&rsquo;s after: He&rsquo;s trying to evolve
a radio device for the broadcasting of scenes.
Thus, for instance, there would be a broadcasting
equipment when the President takes his oath of
office, when Babe Ruth plays ball, when the Belmont
Stakes or the Kentucky Derby are run, when
Bill Tilden and Suzanne Lenglen take on the world
at tennis, when a new play is given its premiere;
and the fellow sitting out in the mountains, far
from everywhere, or over in our house or yours,
Bob, with special equipment, why, he&rsquo;d see it all,
just as if he were present. And he&rsquo;d hear, too.
What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Various expressions of disbelief rose from the
group, except that Bob and Frank sat silent, nodding
their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to come,&rdquo; said Frank, when the
others had in a measure subsided.</p>
<p>And Bob added with conviction: &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come if
Jack helps out this old professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after a moment he added gloomily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Frank and I won&rsquo;t be in on it. We&rsquo;ll be
down in the shipping room stencilling exports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A merry laugh, which Bob somehow felt was a
bit unfeeling, greeted this reference to the fact that
at the end of the Summer vacation he and Frank
were scheduled to enter the export house which
their respective fathers had built up as partners,
and which Mr. Temple had conducted alone since
the death of his associate and lifelong friend,
Frank&rsquo;s father, years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Bob,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You expressed
somewhat the same sentiments, if I remember
aright, down in Laredo not so long ago. Nothing
exciting was ever going to happen to you again,
you said. Yet look at all the fun you had the very
next minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>And so, with this little prevision of the future,
let us bid a temporary farewell to the Radio Boys,
feeling fairly well assured that when we next encounter
them Jack, and not Bob, will prove to have
been the better prophet.</p>

<p>Frank Chadwick and Jack Templeton, young American lads,
meet each other in an unusual way soon after the declaration
of war. Circumstances place them on board the British cruiser,
&ldquo;The Sylph,&rdquo; and from there on, they share adventures with
the sailors of the Allies. Ensign Robert L. Drake, the author,
is an experienced naval officer, and he describes admirably the
many exciting adventures of the two boys.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
